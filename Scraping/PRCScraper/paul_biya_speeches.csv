Of course, I was thinking about our achieving emerging economy status by 2035, which would validate the strides we have made in terms of democracy and economic and social progress. Well, I believe that the situation is proving me right.
There was a need to address, as a priority, the long-pending issue of implementation of decentralization. The Major National Dialogue paved the way for adoption, by Parliament, of the General Code of Regional and Local Authorities and a law which guarantees the use of English and French on an equal footing. Without delay, I promulgated these instruments into law.
Therefore, nothing stands in the way of their application any more. This is indeed a peaceful revolution that meets the aspirations of our fellow citizens to greater participation in the management of local affairs. Besides, the North-West and South-West Regions have been granted a special status with provisions reflecting their social and cultural specificities.
You may wonder why I dwell on an issue that does not specifically concern you. I do so for two reasons:
- Firstly, yours will be the maiden generation of youths to take advantage of the opportunities that will open up for those wishing to engage in the local governance sphere. I urge you to do so.
- Secondly, the new process of decentralization serves as an example. It proves that the problems related to development of our society can be resolved through consultation without resorting to violence.
I wish to underscore this point because there are far too many places worldwide - particularly in Africa - where violence wreaks suffering on the people. We do not want this to happen in Cameroon. Our goal remains to build a peaceful, democratic, just and prosperous society.
Accordingly, we will keep up efforts to achieve that goal by focusing on the development of our educational system.
Although its quality has attained an acceptable level, it will continue to be accorded special attention by the Government. For instance, in 2020, the budget allocations for all types of education combined, represent around one-seventh of public spending.
Young people with sound training and education will naturally be more likely to emerge as responsible citizens and find employment.
Finding employment, particularly for the youth, remains a cause for concern, because for the time being, there is mismatch between employment demand and supply. The Government and the Ministry of Employment and Vocational Training are making every effort to provide solutions to this problem. The former through its recruitment into the public service and the army, and the latter through the implementation of various employment assistance programmes.
However, it must be acknowledged that though laudable, such efforts are unlikely to resolve a problem stemming from the fact that our economy does not generate enough jobs. This difficulty notwithstanding, it is gratifying to know that, according to statistics, slightly over 500 000 jobs were created last year in the modern sector of our economy.
The said sector’s current situation is attributable to the different crises witnessed over the last two decades. I mentioned this issue recently in my end-of-year message to the Nation.
In substance, I stated that our economic recovery was relatively satisfactory and that our growth was once again on the uptrend. However, I also stated that the global context remained uncertain and that we had to redouble our efforts to stay on the path of emergence.  Earlier, I had the opportunity to deplore our heavy dependence on the outside world and to suggest that we should reduce it.
Such is the meaning of our development policy which aims to modernize our agriculture, stimulate our industrialization, particularly by processing our agricultural and mineral commodities, and develop digital technology. This will enable us to reduce our imports, increase our exports and create new employment areas. It behoves you, my dear young compatriots, to take on this challenging task in the coming decades.
Furthermore, the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Civic Education will continue its activities to the benefit of youths in the areas of civic education and national integration, economic integration and implementation of the Three-Year Special Youth Plan. Such is the case with the Youth Connekt Cameroon initiative that was launched recently in Yaounde.
These various programmes concern several hundreds of thousands of young people.
Regarding our reasons for legitimate satisfaction, I will mention the victories scored by our young sportsmen and sportswomen on the world stage, which include:
- the 2nd Africa Cup of Nations trophy lifted by our Under-17 Men’s Football Team in April 2019;
- the 2nd African Women's Volleyball Championship trophy won by our Women’s National Volleyball Team in July 2019; and
- the designation, in January 2020, of our Women's National Football Team as the best women’s football team on the continent.
I believe that we can take pride in our young sportsmen and sportswomen through whom Cameroon's flag is flying very   high.
Not too long ago, during a Council of Ministers meeting, I requested the Government to consider designing a national drug and alcohol abuse control plan. Such abuse had reached an alarming level among the Cameroonian youth. Once more, I am calling on the Government today to redouble its efforts to combat this scourge.
I also avail myself of the opportunity of this Youth Day celebration to, again, appeal to our young compatriots in the North-West and South-West Regions. Those who have allowed themselves to be lured into armed gangs and who continue to maintain a climate of insecurity in these two regions should lay down their weapons, like many who have already done so and who are living peacefully in our communities. Once again, I urge them to come out of the bush and rejoin their other fellow young citizens who are leading normal lives in our society.
I cannot conclude without mentioning a recent incident that has shocked our consciences: the murder, in Yaounde, of a young mathematics teacher by one of his students. This incredible act speaks volumes about the excesses of our modern societies.
I call on parents, the clergy and teachers to prevent, through their teachings, such acts from happening again. I also urge you to reflect on what has happened, to ponder its gravity and to resolve to never again commit such acts.
I take this opportunity to once more extend my heartfelt condolences to the bereaved parents.
Sixty years ago – when I was your age, Cameroon gained its independence. That had been the dream of the youth in those days and that dream came true.
The task ahead was huge. We were aware of this. It took a lot of effort, but also blood and tears, to get to where we are today. Generations of youth like you devoted their lives for us to get here. We have no reason to be ashamed of what they achieved.
Today, a large majority of Cameroonians can eat their fill, receive health care, enrol in primary and secondary schools and university, and have the right to express themselves and to vote freely.
Of course, much remains to be accomplished. We will do so together. Together, we will build the just and prosperous society to which we aspire.
For the good of our country, I need you.
Happy Youth Day!
Long live Cameroonian Youth! And
Long Live Cameroon!

Yaounde, 24 January 2020
 
 
In recent years, the security of our country has been put to severe test. Three of our regions in particular have been or are affected by insecurity.
In the Far-North, sporadic raids by the Boko Haram terrorist organization continue to wreak death and desolation among our citizens.
On our border in the East Region, various atrocities are being perpetrated by highway robbers.
In the North-West and South-West, secessionists, who have morphed into numerous armed gangs, continue to commit atrocities and to destroy the property of some of our fellow citizens whose sole aspiration is to live in peace.
Yet, multiple and urgent appeals for peace have been made. Several measures have been taken to persuade those who have risen against their fatherland to lay down their weapons and return to the path of reason through their peaceful reintegration into society.
Unfortunately, a few groups continue to fuel insecurity in some places in the two regions.
However, thanks to the determination of our defence and security forces to protect our fellow citizens in the North-West and South-West, the situation has significantly improved. It is hoped that the new measures taken following the Major National Dialogue will contribute towards restoring lasting peace and calm.
I would like to take this opportunity to recall the crucial role of our defence and security forces. They are required not only to protect the Nation from any external aggression, but also to counter any threat against our national unity.
They have been carrying out this dual task with admirable courage and efficiency and, it must be said, making huge sacrifices. That is why, today, I wish to reassure them of the support of our entire Nation and my personal esteem.
Turning now to the cadet officers of the “Major General Kodji Jacob"" batch, whose graduation we celebrate this day, I urge you to draw inspiration from the example set by this brilliant senior officer after whom your batch has been christened.
Major General Kodji Jacob fell in the line of duty on 22 January 2017, when his helicopter crashed as he was returning from a reconnaissance mission in the Far North, in the context of the fight against the Boko Haram terrorist sect. He was then the ""Emergence 4"" Operation Commander.
Throughout his career, he distinguished himself through his bravery, intelligence and closeness to his troops.
For three years, you underwent gruelling training at the Combined Military Services Academy. As you are now equipped with the basic requisite knowledge for discharging the duties that you will be assigned, and trained on republican values, you must adapt to our country’s overall context.
This context is characterized by the existence of new forms of threat. You may have to face so-called asymmetric conflicts. You may also have to combat cybercrime which can, at the same time, undermine national security and destabilize the national economy.
You are now members of a republican Army. Accordingly, in performing your duties, you must respect human rights and be defenders of the well-being of your compatriots.
I also urge you to always work in synergy with them and to provide them assistance whenever necessary. Such is one of the conditions for the success of your missions.
Similarly, I recommend that you establish close collaboration with local authorities. Also make sure you remain close to your subordinates, of course, with due observance of discipline which is the strength of the armed forces.
At this juncture, I wish to congratulate the senior civil and military staff, at various levels of the chain of command, for their hard work and dedication during your training.
I also hail the success of your fellow cadet officers from brotherly countries, namely the Central African Republic, the Republic of Congo, the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire, the Gabonese Republic and the Republic of Guinea. Their presence in your midst bears eloquent testimony to the recognition your Academy enjoys, the vitality of sub-regional and regional cooperation, as well as the excellent ties existing between Cameroon and their respective countries.
Lastly, I wish to congratulate you for choosing the arms profession. It is one that demands extraordinary skills. It is also and above all a special calling as it entails the eventuality of the supreme sacrifice. This is what one 19th century poet referred to as ""military servitude and grandeur"".
As you prepare to return to your various units, I recommend that you follow in the footsteps of your predecessors, whose services have remained in keeping with the motto of our Army, ""Honour and Fidelity"".
Long live the Cameroon Defence and Security Forces!
Long live Cameroon!

The Dean of the Diplomatic Corps,
I would, first of all, like to thank you for the kind and encouraging words you have just spoken about my country.
Distinguished Members of the Diplomatic Corps,
The decade that has just ended, like the past year, was marked by serious threats to international peace and security. Faced with the huge challenges posed to humanity as a whole, namely terrorism, climate change, migratory movements, the rise of populism, etc., the international community made multiple efforts to find solutions. However, much remains to be done.
Even though the fight against terrorism is recording some success in Syria and Iraq, there is concern that without genuine and sincere solidarity among States, this scourge could spread to other parts of the world and intensify. I am thinking particularly of Africa, especially the Sahel region where Mauritania, Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso and Chad are already affected.
Cameroon has not been spared.
This affords me the opportunity to commend the G5 Sahel Member States which are making considerable efforts to neutralize terrorists. I also pay tribute to France whose troops are participating courageously in the fight against jihadists, under Operation Barkhane.
Cameroon, for its part, is working together with all the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin and international partners of goodwill to neutralize the Boko Haram sect’s capacity to wreak havoc.
Such solidarity is all the more necessary as our developing States need increased financial resources to build road, rail, port, energy and industrial infrastructure for their development. Such facilities foster the creation of many jobs that can dissuade our youths from venturing into other continents, thus sparing us the unfortunate incidents that have turned the Mediterranean Sea into a vast, hideous cemetery at the dawn of the 21st century.
The Dean of the Diplomatic Corps,
Distinguished Members of the Diplomatic Corps,
The international community is also duty-bound to seek solutions to the trade tensions existing between major powers, which do not only limit global trade, but also undermine the development opportunities of our States.
Similarly, special attention must be paid to the increasingly obvious risk of challenging multilateralism which has so far spared the human community another global conflict.
This challenge is unfortunately accompanied by the advent, in some countries, of “populist governments” that favour national solutions to global and common problems.
It is hoped that there will be a collective awareness that environmental, climate, development and migration issues sufficiently demonstrate the interdependence of States and the need to act in a spirit of solidarity to find appropriate solutions to them.
Distinguished Members of the Diplomatic Corps,
During the year just ended, Cameroon redoubled its efforts to maintain peace and security across its territory.
Thus, in the Far-North Region, we beefed up the presence of our Defence and Security Forces in order to curb or even prevent incursions by terrorists of the Boko Haram sect who, unfortunately, continue to cause human and material losses.
I would like to avail myself of this opportunity to make a fraternal appeal to all the affected countries of the Lake Chad basin to remobilize and redouble their efforts in order to permanently neutralize these terrorists.
Regarding the problems in our North-West and South-West Regions, various measures have been taken to objectively anticipate a return to lasting peace in the short term.
The Major National Dialogue afforded an opportunity to make recommendations, some of which are being implemented, with laws recently passed by Parliament. Thus, our two regions of the North-West and South-West have been granted, within the framework of our Republic, a special status which largely meets the aspirations of our fellow citizens living there.
I take this opportunity to express our gratitude to friendly countries and international organizations such as the United Nations, the Commonwealth, La Francophonie and the African Union for their understanding, assistance and support in the management of this sensitive problem.
Regarding the economy, Cameroon intends to resolutely continue its march towards emergence, despite difficulties and pitfalls. Its National Development Strategy for the period 2020-2030 aims to achieve that goal.
Our country also welcomes the coming into force of the African Continental Free Trade Area which, it hopes, will offer new prospects for intra-African trade.
On the diplomatic front, Cameroon played host to many high-ranking foreign dignitaries and heads of international organizations in 2019. With all these guests, I shared the viewpoint of our country which needs peace and security, conditions conducive to sustainable development to which all our compatriots legitimately aspire.
This is the reason why I participated in the Peace Forum held last November in Paris.
Because of my country’s firm resolve to eradicate the pandemics of AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, I attended the Sixth Replenishment Conference of the Global Fund devoted to the fight against these diseases.
At that conference, Cameroon made a substantial contribution commensurate with its level of resources and development. Once more, I would like to commend the efforts made by France which mobilized the international community to ensure that the Global Fund to fight these pandemics receives the requisite resources   for its work.
Distinguished Members of the Diplomatic Corps,
In my opinion, the international community still has to answer the following question: can the world continue to evolve in a context of “trade war”, mistrust between States and misunderstanding between the citizens and those who govern them?
If, as one would imagine, the answer is negative, I believe that only an international conference at the highest level could lay the groundwork for “Act II of globalization”, to borrow from an eminent political scientist[1], that is, globalization that places man and his environment at the centre of any economic activity.
The Dean of the Diplomatic Corps,
Distinguished Members of the Diplomatic Corps,
I would now like to request you to kindly convey my best wishes for the New Year to the high authorities you represent.
I also extend to you and your families my most sincere wishes for happiness, health and success in 2020
Long live international cooperation!
Long live international solidarity!
Thank you for your attention.

[1] Professor Bertrand Badie (Sciences Po – Paris).",https://prc.cm/en/news/speeches-of-the-president/4058-head-of-state-s-new-year-message-to-the-nation-31-december-2019
https://prc.cm/en/news/speeches-of-the-president/4058-head-of-state-s-new-year-message-to-the-nation-31-december-2019,/en/news/speeches-of-the-president/4058-head-of-state-s-new-year-message-to-the-nation-31-december-2019,"Fellow Cameroonians,
My dear compatriots,
Last year, under the same circumstances, I reviewed, before you, the situation in three key areas of the life of our country.
Together, we noted that the security situation in our North-West and South-West Regions was still a cause for concern despite calls for insurgents to lay down their arms. Accordingly, finding a solution had to be given priority.
We also observed that our economic growth was improving, but needed to be strengthened to stay on the path of emergence.
Lastly, it was demonstrated that social progress in Cameroon is not mere rhetoric. This major complement to our democratic system is making great strides in its various components, namely education, health, employment, etc., although obviously, there is still room for improvement.
How have we fared one year on?
This is a huge task requiring significant financial resources. The budgetary allocations devoted to it are substantial, and, of course, depend on the level of government revenue that is also contingent upon the soundness of our economy, which I will be addressing in a moment.
In any case, note that the efforts made over the last few years in this domain will be continued and, if possible, stepped up.
Much effort has been made recently to improve this situation under the Economic and Financial Programme concluded with the IMF. Our growth has picked up again, inflation is under control, budget and external deficits are contained and our public debt remains sustainable.
The Government’s 2020 Economic, Financial, Social and Cultural Programme, which was presented recently before the National Assembly, is consistent with this trend. It is based on a 4% growth assumption, which is expected to keep us on the path to emergence by 2035. Moreover, our draft National Development Strategy for the 2020-2030 period seeks to achieve the same objective.
I wish to avail myself of this opportunity to thank our foreign partners, including the IMF which I have already mentioned, the World Bank, the African Development Bank and the French Development Agency, for their budget support and assistance to our structural reforms.
Does this mean that we may now rest on our laurels? Of course not. Our goal remains to become an emerging economy by 2035. However, what with the unstable global context and the tensions that are jeopardizing trade, we may need to redouble our efforts to maintain our country on the path of sustainable economic recovery. I believe we can do it.
We must consider such recovery an overriding obligation that will mobilize all our energies. Accordingly, it requires not only improving the living conditions of Cameroonians, but also ensuring the peaceful exercise of democratic rights.
Without a doubt, this is one of the most urgent problems at the moment. The criminal activities of armed groups continue to disrupt public, economic, and social life in these regions, yet various measures have been taken in recent months to reason with these youths, most of who have been brainwashed. They have been called upon to lay down their weapons, and social reintegration prospects have been offered them.
For those who persist in going down the wrong road   and continue to use violence, we will have no other choice than to combat them in order to protect all our fellow citizens. Our Defence and Security Forces will, once again, perform their duty with restraint, but without weakness. I wish to reassure them of my full support and high esteem.
Earlier on, decisions had been taken to convince our compatriots in the two regions concerned of Government’s willingness to devolve to local authorities the powers that would enable them to play a greater role in managing local affairs. It had also been confirmed that provisions were to be made to fast-track the promotion of bilingualism and multiculturalism.
Furthermore, it is worth noting that the Nation at large showed support for Government’s policy by expressing, in various ways, solidarity with the populations who suffered the abuses and atrocities of armed gangs.
However, aware of the long period of time required to implement planned reforms, and in a bid to put an end to the hassles and suffering of our compatriots in the North-West and South-West Regions, I decided to open, as from end-September – permit me to quote myself – “a Major National Dialogue that will, in line with our Constitution, enable us to seek ways and means of meeting the profound aspirations of the people of the North-West and South-West Regions, but also of all the other components of our Nation”.
I dwelled on this in a message to all our compatriots on 10 September 2019. I had the feeling that the initiative was largely approved by the national public and various international organizations, including the United Nations and many friendly countries.
The “Major Dialogue”, which was preceded, as I indicated, by various peace offers to the insurgents, accompanied by the release of hundreds of detainees, was effectively held from 30 September to 4 October 2019. It brought together a wide array of representatives of Cameroon’s civil society.
Today, I wish to thank all those who kindly participated in the dialogue, and congratulate its organizers, in particular the Prime Minister, Head of Government.
It seemed to me that for participants, this marked a great opportunity for communion whereby they expressed their attachment to peace and national unity.
I noted with satisfaction that all Cameroonians welcomed many of the proposals made during the Major National Dialogue.
Accordingly, on 10 December 2019, a bill on the promotion of bilingualism and multiculturalism was passed by the National Assembly and the Senate. It provides for equal use of English and French in all our public institutions. I am convinced that the effective implementation of this law will strengthen our country’s bilingual nature.
Furthermore, on 15 December 2019, a bill to institute the General Code of Regional and Local Authorities was tabled before our two Houses of Parliament, namely the National Assembly and the Senate, for consideration in an extraordinary session. Thus our Members of the National Assembly and our Senators passed a law with decisive breakthroughs in our decentralization process, notably regarding the status of local elected officials, the functioning of local assemblies and the allocation of additional, substantial financial resources to regions.
Concerning the North-West and South-West Regions in particular, the special status granted them takes into account the specificities of the Anglophone education sub-system, Common Law and traditional authorities.
My dear compatriots,
As you can see, a new Cameroon is taking shape; a Cameroon that is adapted to present times and looks to the future.
To get to where we are, we encountered many hurdles, and as in the past, together, we overcome all of them.
In this seven-year term of Great Opportunities for Cameroon, the Major National Dialogue has paved the way for our country to resolutely embark on the path to peace, national unity and progress, which are values that have always made our country great.
Fellow Cameroonians,
My dear compatriots,
Before concluding, I would like to say a few words about our democratic system.
When the conditions were right and, together, we laid the foundations of democracy in our country, I was aware that the road would be strewn with obstacles. This actually happened, but we have been able to make remarkable progress.
Unfortunately, a minority, in Cameroon and abroad, seem to have forgotten the rules that govern life in a democracy. Needless to recall that the sole arbiter in a democracy is the sovereign people. When the sovereign people make a choice through free and fair elections and the results are proclaimed after review of petitions, such results must be recognized and accepted by all.
Neither the social media nor news outlets can change the outcome of an election, talk less of illegal protests, violence and personal or hate-filled attacks. Remember, I once said “Let’s talk, let’s not fight”. Such is the behaviour of the citizens of a democratic country.
Participation in the democratic life of one’s country requires compliance with its rules and joining political parties which carry out their activities within the confines of the law. This will be tested during the upcoming 9 February 2020 municipal and legislative elections.
Security measures have been taken to ensure that all our fellow citizens countrywide exercise their voting rights. Where necessary, such measures will be ramped up. Therefore, I urge all Cameroonians who are registered on the electoral roll to go and vote, bearing in mind that they will be electing the men and women who will translate into reality the reforms desired by the Cameroonian people, notably fast-tracking the implementation of decentralization.
Regarding the excesses of some of our compatriots of the Diaspora, whether or not they still have Cameroonian nationality, I believe they should, out of patriotism, refrain from using negative language against their country of origin. One must respect one’s fatherland, its institutions and those who embody them.
My dear compatriots,
Together, let us make Cameroon a land of great opportunities for economic and social development in peace and unity.
Happy and Prosperous New Year 2020 to everyone!
Long Live the Republic!
Long Live Cameroon!

Ladies and Gentlemen,
At the opening of this Summit, I expressed our common feeling of satisfaction with the current positive economic and financial performance of our Community.
This, above all, is the outcome of the measures adopted and implemented following the 2016 Summit.
I also recalled that the global macroeconomic context is still marked by multiple and major risks.
At the same time, persistent inequalities and exclusion in our societies, huge job needs for youth and women and global security challenges remain major causes for concern.
In this regard, I believe our deliberations of today have clearly demonstrated the need for us to resolutely continue with the actions we initiated three years ago. Achieving our development goals strongly depends on it.
With the support of our traditional partners and friends, our common economic and financial recovery strategy should be continued.
In particular, I would like to underscore that budget consolidation should be of a realistic nature, to be able to create conditions conducive to the revival of growth and improvement of the living conditions of the people.
Regarding our monetary policy, it has so far helped to maintain the financial stability of our sub-region. However, we should remain open to reform proposals aimed at strengthening our action and creating favourable conditions for the effective contribution of the monetary policy to the development of our sub-region.
Concerning our exchange rate regime, we can be satisfied that the current level of our reserves is in harmony with our fixed exchange rate regime. Also, we need to pursue reforms to strengthen and support the sub-regional banking sector.
Furthermore, having merged our stock markets, we should complete sub-regional financial integration by optimizing the operation of our various financial market stakeholders.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Undoubtedly, integration constitutes the principal strategic driver of our Community. More than ever before, we should work towards ensuring its acceleration by fully implementing the free movement of persons and goods.
In the same vein, we should, as soon as possible, implement our integrating projects with the financial support of our bilateral and multilateral partners. Furthermore, we should consolidate our economic diversification and ensure the significant improvement of the business climate to raise the level of private investment.
Distinguished Heads of State and Government, 
Ladies and Gentlemen,
CEMAC is endowed with all the requisite economic and human resources to ensure   the economic development of its members and well-being of its people. It behoves us   collectively, in conjunction with our partners, to create conditions conducive to the enhancement of its efficiency.
In the past, we have been able to hold in check various types of crises, through a common, coherent and concerted approach.
Let us continue along this path and together strive to translate this community ideal into reality.
Thank you for your kind attention.

Mr President of the African Development Bank,
Mr President of the CEMAC Commission,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
First and foremost, I would like to wish you and your delegations a warm and fraternal welcome to Yaounde, as well as a pleasant stay in our midst.
I also wish to sincerely thank you for honouring my invitation. Your presence at this Summit bears eloquent testimony to your attachment to sub-regional integration and to the principles of the institution tasked with promoting it.
I would like, in particular, to acknowledge the presence of Dr AKINWUMI ADESINA, President of the African Development Bank, as well as that of the representatives of the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and France. Your constant support is highly appreciated and very beneficial.
Distinguished Heads of State and Government,
As you would remember, in 2016 when the macroeconomic and fiscal balances of our countries came under severe threat, dangerously impacting our foreign exchange reserve positions, we met here in Yaounde and adopted important resolutions to check the looming crisis.
It is worth noting with satisfaction that, three years on, most of our States have implemented the resolutions. Others are in the process of doing so. As a result, we note that the economic situation in our sub-region is improving substantially. The growth rate in our sub-region stood at 1.8% in 2018 and inflation below 3%. Budget and external deficits have reduced considerably. Public debt stands at about 50% of gross domestic product (GDP) for the entire Community. Foreign exchange reserves in the CEMAC zone now stand at over three months of imports, thus ruling out the risk of currency adjustment.
Distinguished Heads of State and Government,
While it is undeniable that the economic and financial trends in our sub-region are positive, there are lingering vulnerabilities. The global macroeconomic context is uncertain. Geopolitical and trade tensions pose a threat to the development of global trade. This context led the International Monetary Fund to review downwards its global growth projections for the current year. Commodity price volatility continues to impact our economies which, more than ever before, need further diversification. Our public finances remain under severe stress from security challenges.
Accordingly, there is every reason to consider that  this meeting affords us  another opportunity to discuss and adopt further measures to consolidate the economic recovery of our sub-region, while bearing in mind that our common goal remains accelerating growth to meet the legitimate employment aspirations of our population, especially the youth.
Distinguished Heads of State and Government,
As current President of CEMAC, I wish to avail myself of this opportunity to extend, on your behalf, our heartfelt thanks to our development partners whose contribution has enabled our sub-region to restore its internal and external balances.
I particularly hail the action of Madam LAGARDE, former Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund. My gratitude also goes to the World Bank, the African Development Bank and the French Development Agency for their substantial budget support and structural reform assistance.
All these institutions formed part of our drive towards concerted solutions in 2016. We once again appeal for their invaluable inputs to enable CEMAC countries to achieve their desired status of emerging economies.
As you would have noted, our sub-region is determined to maintain its drive towards achieving sustainable development and progress. Despite its multiple potential obstacles, our sub-region remains determined to be resilient.
It is determined to stand tall.
It is determined to remain a pole of stability and prosperity.
Thank you.

My Dear Compatriots,
For close to three years now, the North-West and South-West Regions of our country have been going through a crisis that not only jeopardizes the safety and        well-being of the population living there, but also has far-reaching consequences for the national community as a whole.
It should be recalled that the crisis was triggered by corporate demands made by lawyers and teachers calling for the translation of the OHADA Uniform Acts into English and the preservation of the specificity of the Anglo-Saxon judicial and educational systems in the two regions.
From the outset, and true to an option that I hold dear, I instructed the holding of dialogue between the Government and trade unions to seek appropriate solutions to these demands. The measures taken by the Government at the end of these consultations went well beyond the initial demands and include:
- the translation into English of the OHADA instruments which are now available in the two official languages;
- the creation of a Common Law Section at the Supreme Court to handle appeals filed against the decisions of lower courts in Common Law matters;
- regarding the training of judicial and legal officers, the creation of a Common Law Section at the National  School of Administration and Magistracy. This measure was accompanied by a programme for the recruitment of English-speaking pupil judicial and legal officers and court registrars;
- the launching of the special recruitment of bilingual teachers in secondary schools;
- at the level of the judiciary, the stay of proceedings against some persons arrested in connection with the demands;
- the setting up of a national Commission for the Promotion of Bilingualism and  Multi-culturalism to, among other things, carry out an in-depth review of all the sources of frustration suffered by our compatriots in the North-West and        South-West Regions.
Decisions were taken subsequently to fast-track the decentralization process, with the creation of a new ministry devoted thereto. The upcoming regional elections will complete the process by enabling our compatriots nationwide to fully participate in the management of their local affairs.
My Dear Compatriots,
Despite the efforts made by the Government, radical movements, mainly inspired from abroad, have exploited and distorted the corporate demands. They have thus hatched a secessionist plan to partition our country. In this regard, they have formed and financed armed groups that have caused untold harm to the population of the North-West and South-West Regions.
The whole world has witnessed the atrocities committed by these armed groups: maiming, beheading, assassination of elements of the Defence and Security Forces, administrative authorities and defenceless civilians, destruction of public infrastructure and buildings, and burning of schools, hospitals, etc.
I would like to avail myself of this opportunity to once again extend my heartfelt condolences and those of the entire Nation to those who have lost loved ones in the crisis. I also wish to send a message of comfort to the wounded and all those affected in one way or the other. I want to assure them that they can count on the solidarity of the Government of the Republic and the Nation as a whole.
My Dear Compatriots   
The atrocities committed by armed groups have forced thousands of our compatriots to seek refuge in other regions of the country and, for some, in neighbouring countries where they have been reduced to living under precarious conditions.
In the face of these intolerable acts, the Defence and Security Forces have taken energetic measures, often at the risk of their lives, to perform their duty of protecting citizens and their property.
These measures are currently bearing fruits with the improvement of security and the progressive resumption of economic activities in the two regions.
My Dear Compatriots,
Since the outbreak of this crisis, I have spared no effort, with the help of Cameroonians of good will, in seeking ways and means for its peaceful resolution.
In a bid to calm the situation, I even ordered the discontinuance of judicial proceedings pending before military tribunals against 289 persons arrested for offences committed during this crisis.
In the same vein, I extended a hand of peace to members of armed groups by calling on them to lay down their arms and benefit from the process of reintegration into society. A National Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration Committee was thus set up. Regional Disarmament Centres are gradually receiving many ex-combatants who willingly accept to lay down their arms.  We will continue to make the necessary efforts to fully operationalize this process.
At the humanitarian level, I decided to launch a large-scale assistance plan for our affected compatriots of the North-West and South-West Regions. I also established a Centre for the Coordination of Humanitarian Action for its implementation. I wish to thank our international partners for supporting us in this initiative.
My Dear Compatriots,
The supposed feeling of marginalization by the people of the North-West and South-West Regions has often been advanced to justify this crisis. On this score, I wish to remind our compatriots in these regions, but also to those in the other eight regions of Cameroon, that marginalization, exclusion or stigmatization have never guided the work of the various governments I have formed since I became president of our country. Though no human endeavour is perfect and, in a developing country like ours with multiple challenges and limited resources, many needs are still to be met, in all the regions.
With the massive support you gave me during the last presidential election, I intend to work relentlessly, with all the sons and daughters of our country, towards meeting the challenges we are facing in order to improve the welfare of our population, especially in terms of infrastructure, water and electricity supply, healthcare delivery and youth employment.
My Dear Compatriots,
On 4 January this year, I made a vast government reshuffle, particularly with the appointment of a new Prime Minister, Head of Government. As usual, the choice of these officials was mainly guided by their human and professional qualities, their competence and experience. However, I would like to underscore that as faithful as I have always been to the regional balance policy, I chose a Prime Minister who hails from the       South-West Region. His predecessor who served in that key position for nearly ten years was from the North-West Region. In fact, since 9 April 1992, Prime Ministers, Heads of Government, have been appointed from among the people of those two regions.
Despite all this, some people will continue to talk of marginalization of the people of these regions. It must be acknowledged that such is human nature and there will never be enough duty posts to satisfy all the regions, divisions, sub-divisions, towns, villages, families and citizens of our country. Any choice that is made will always cause joy whenever one is honoured, and disappointment when one is not.
It is, however, crucial for us to change our mentalities in this regard. Though it is necessary to consider regional balance in new countries with a diverse sociological composition like ours, it should be recalled that ministers and other officials are not appointed to serve only their regions, villages or families, but to serve the entire national community. They must serve the general interest and not specific interests.
That is why since I came to power, I have and will continue to wage a ruthless war against corruption and the embezzlement of public funds, and to promote good governance.
My Dear Compatriots,
Since the outbreak of the crisis in the North-West and South-West Regions, the term dialogue has never been so much talked about, used and even misused.
In and out of the country, people have made proposals and suggestions. Some are realistic while others are clearly less so. There has been a barrage of advice. Some smart, others based on interests. Some people dared to issue injunctions.
There have also been multiple and varied initiatives, most of them made by people of good faith, by countries or organizations that are truly concerned about the future of our country and the well-being of our people. I wish to thank them for their effort and token of friendship.
It is, however, worth noting that the proliferation of such initiatives was sometimes unfortunately based on simplistic and false ideas, born out of secessionist propaganda. Such is the case with the purported marginalization of Anglophones, persecution of the Anglophone minority by the Francophone majority, Government’s refusal to engage in dialogue preferring a military solution to the crisis or even ridiculous accusations of genocide.
Talking about dialogue per se, the issue has always been, with whom?
New information and communication technologies, especially social media networks, have unfortunately facilitated the advent of self-proclaimed leaders, extremists of all shades trying to achieve recognition using insult, threat, hate speech, violence and murder.
However, in no country in the world, has the killing of gendarmes or civilians, kidnapping, mutilation, molestation, burning, destruction of public infrastructure, prevention of children from going to school or people from going about their activities in peace ever been a source of legitimacy to represent or speak on behalf of the people, the very victims of such atrocities.
In democracy, only elections confer such legitimacy.
My Dear Compatriots,
The many consultations I have continued to hold on this crisis have enabled me to size up the strong desire of the people of the North-West and South-West Regions to return to a normal life, to be able once again to safely carry out their economic and social activities, to witness the return of refugees and displaced persons, and to see their children return to school. The Prime Minister’s recent tour of the two regions has helped to confirm this feeling.
I therefore strongly believe that the time has come to rally all well-thinking and constructive forces in our country and in the diaspora to make this desire come true.
That is why I have decided to convene, from the end of this month, a major national dialogue that will, in line with our Constitution, enable us to seek ways and means of meeting the high aspirations of the people of the North-West and South-West Regions, but also of all the other components of our Nation.
The dialogue in question will mainly concern the situation in the North-West and South-West Regions. Since it will focus on issues of national interest such as national unity, national integration and living together, it is obvious that it will not concern only the population of these two regions.
The dialogue will therefore rally all the sons and daughters of our beloved and beautiful country, Cameroon, to reflect on values that are dear to us, namely: peace, security, national unity and progress.
It will also focus on issues that can address the concerns of the population of the North-West and South-West Regions, as well as those of the other regions of our country such as bilingualism, cultural diversity and social cohesion, the reconstruction and development of conflict-affected areas, the return of refugees and displaced persons, the education and judicial system, decentralization and local development, the demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants, the role of the diaspora in the country’s development, etc.
The dialogue, which will be chaired by the Prime Minister, Head of Government, will bring together a wide range of personalities: parliamentarians, politicians, opinion leaders, intellectuals, economic operators, traditional authorities, religious authorities, members of the diaspora, etc. Representatives of the Defence and Security Forces, armed groups and victims will also be invited.
Obviously, it will not be possible for everybody to effectively participate in this dialogue, but each person will have the opportunity to make a contribution.
Prior to the effective holding of the dialogue, the Prime Minister, Head of Government, will carry out broad-based consultations to solicit a wide range of views that will serve as a source of inspiration for the conduct of deliberations. In the coming days, delegations will also be dispatched to meet the diaspora to enable them to make their contribution to discussions on the resolution of the crisis.
In this regard, I am appealing to the patriotism and sense of responsibility of all our compatriots in the country and in the diaspora so that everyone, wherever they are, should seize this historic opportunity to help to steer our country on the path of peace, harmony, security and progress.
My Dear Compatriots,
The propaganda of secessionists has tried to present the recent court decisions taken against a number of our compatriots in the context of this crisis as an obstacle to the dialogue envisaged.
That is not the case. I also wish to use this opportunity to stress that respect for the rule of law and the fight against impunity are pillars in the consolidation of a State ruled by law to which we all aspire. Violating the rule of law and granting impunity to some citizens is paving the way for anarchy.
It is therefore crucial, at this stage, to dispel rumours that one can quietly loot, rape, burn, kidnap, maim, murder, in the hope that a possible dialogue will erase all these crimes and provide impunity to their perpetrators.
As shown by the experience of many countries in the world, such way of thinking will only encourage the perpetuation of violence in the crisis regions and even encourage it in crisis-free regions.
Admittedly, however, in the context of a dialogue, a peace process or national reconciliation, the possibility of pardon may be considered, under certain conditions.
It is equally true that in accordance with our Constitution, the Head of State is empowered to exercise the right of pardon.
It was, moreover, on the strength of this authority that I made a peace offer to members of armed groups during my recent swearing-in ceremony.
I wish to solemnly reiterate this offer today.  Those who voluntarily lay down their arms and place themselves at the disposal of the Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR) Centres have nothing to fear. Their fellow armed group members who are already there can testify to this. Conversely, those who persist in committing criminal acts and violating the laws of the Republic will have to contend with our Defence and Security Forces and will face the full force of those same laws.
The same applies to promoters of hate and violence who, comfortably settled in foreign countries with impunity, continue to incite murder and destruction. Let them know that sooner or later they will have to face justice.
I am appealing to the countries sheltering these extremists to take action against these criminals if they really care about the situation of the people of the North-West and South-West Regions.
Most of them no longer have Cameroonian nationality, but they spend their time raising funds to carry out terrorist acts in Cameroon, masterminding acts of arson, kidnappings and murder, and issuing calls aimed at preventing children from attending school and fellow citizens from going about their business peacefully.
My Dear Compatriots,
The entire national community has high expectations for the dialogue I have just announced and hopes that this will be an opportunity for our brothers and sisters in the North-West and South-West to close this particularly painful chapter, to forget their suffering and to return to normal life. It also hopes that our country will continue resolutely on the path of progress, through fruitful discussions on ways and means of creating conditions conducive to the optimal exploitation of natural resources and our country's enormous human potential. Therefore, we should all work towards a successful dialogue.
My Dear Compatriots,
Over the years, we have used our linguistic and cultural diversity, the talent of our sons and daughters, and our commendable efforts and sacrifices to build a solid country and a strong Nation. Together we have met many challenges and won uncountable victories. We have proven that united there is no difficulty we cannot overcome and no obstacle we cannot cross. We proved it yesterday. We will prove it again today and tomorrow. The future of our compatriots in the North-West and South-West Regions lies within our Republic.
Cameroon will remain one and indivisible.
Long Live Cameroon!

Last year, on the same occasion, I drew your    attention to the changes that were taking place in the world, which pointed to declining solidarity between nations and a recrudescence of national egoism. Unfortunately, recent trends in relations between States confirm this assertion.
My intention was to make it quite clear to you that we had to prepare for such eventuality by first counting on ourselves and then being less dependent on the outside world. That is why I made the emergence of our country a “national cause”.
It is obvious that you already are and will, in the coming years, be the key actors of such emergence. In that regard, it is not futile to recall that for most nations, and ours in particular, each generation, at one moment or another, had to mobilize to uphold a cause that is considered just and necessary.
For our founding fathers, the cause was independence which is inextricably linked to national unity. For their successors, it was the establishment and consolidation of the institutions of the new State. For the next generation, it was the advent of democracy and social progress. For the present generation, it is modernization of the economy and social justice.
For you, the cause is first of all to protect all our achievements in order to better wage the struggle for emergence. Much has been done over the past years to improve our economic fabric. It will be up to you to continue on the same path. You will have to implement our major agricultural revolution, industrialization, infrastructure, as well as social, education, health and housing projects.
During my swearing-in ceremony last November, I asked you not to lose hope. I am repeating that request today. I am quite aware of your difficulties. I understand your aspiration for change and your desire to be more involved in taking decisions concerning your future. I wish to remind you that tomorrow’s Cameroon will be built with you.
My dear young compatriots,
The year 2018 was marked by the holding of the presidential election in which you participated with enthusiasm either as voters, candidates or actors in the electoral process. Such participation is encouraging as it shows the keen interest you have in the affairs of your country.
This interest should be reinforced and sustained. It stands out from a practice that is now common on social networks and the source of worrying excesses.
Although the principle of this form of direct democracy is not fundamentally wrong, it unfortunately often induces people to adopt positions that are offensive to the authorities, political actors or ordinary citizens. Such political activism often violates not only democratic principles, but also the law.
There is another, more responsible and more commendable, way of being a political activist. By definition, politics refers to the management of society. Voting, standing as a candidate in an election, being elected a municipal or regional councillor, a member of the National Assembly or a senator is engaging in politics in the noble sense of the word. If such is your ambition, do not hesitate to embark on that path for the good of your country.
If you achieve your ambition, you will be participating in building a just, democratic and fraternal society based on our socio-cultural realities and our historical heritage, a society to which our people aspire. You will thus contribute to the quest for solutions to the difficulties that many of our youths are facing in finding a job, starting a family, freeing themselves from outdated customs and resisting the temptation of illegal emigration which is claiming many lives.
You will also have to avoid yielding to idleness which can lead to bad habits such as delinquency and alcohol and drug abuse. The Government will have to take urgent measures to wage a merciless war against these ills that are destroying our youths and which, in the long run, will threaten our country’s future.
My dear young compatriots,
In recent years, I have not been insensitive to your difficulties and your aspirations. During my swearing-in ceremony, I once more made the commitment to facilitate the social integration of youths.
Besides recruitments into the defence and security forces and in some sectors such as education, many ministries have implemented programmes concerning you in particular.
In that connection, the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Civic Education:
- launched the civic education and national integration campaign which involved more than one million youths and led to the training of   1300 conscripts by the National Civic Service Agency for Participation in Development;
- promoted volunteerism which has helped to train thousands of volunteers for education and health development support operations in priority areas;
- supported associations by providing guidance to youth organizations;
- achieved youth socio-economic integration by training thousands of youths, some of whom are entrepreneurs;
- lastly, and above all, implemented the Three-year “Special Youth” Plan involving more than 600 000 people.
Thus, nearly 4 000 projects have been developed in the agricultural, industrial, digital economy and innovation sectors, and adequate financing also provided.
Many other ministries have also implemented activities for the training and integration of youths into the world of work. I would like to mention in particular the efforts made by the ministries in charge of education to promote professionalization.
Despite these remarkable actions, our country continues to face the problem of youth unemployment. We all know why. Our economy is not buoyant enough to absorb the tens of thousands of youths joining the labour market each year. This also explains why many of them are obliged to accept unskilled jobs to avoid unemployment.
Socially, this situation has many adverse consequences. That is why I will continue to:
- encourage the Government to adopt measures to revive the economy;
- urge economic operators from all over the world to invest in Cameroon;
- advise our youths to seize every available employment opportunity.
You should therefore become committed actors of our new second-generation agricultural policy. Similarly, you should avail yourselves of the opportunities offered by the implementation of our Industrialization Plan and the development of digital technology. The goal is to achieve a level of growth commensurate with our aspiration of becoming an emerging country.
In this regard, there is reason to be fairly optimistic, given that our growth rate is once again on the increase. According to forecasts, it could rise from 3.8% in 2018 to 4.4% in 2019 and 4.7% in 2020, with positive spin-offs for youth employment.
Apart from these encouraging renewed growth prospects, mention should also be made of the role of the Ministry of Employment and Vocational Training in promoting employment. More than 500 000 jobs were created in 2018 thanks to the ongoing major projects, agricultural, road and infrastructure projects, as well as the works carried out by regional and local authorities.
Concerning vocational training, the 11 July 2018 law paves the way for the modernization and standardization of training. Vocational training centres of excellence are now operational in Douala, Limbe and Sangmelima. Last year, approved public and private training entities admitted some 40 000 trainees.
There are plans to create no less than 500 000 jobs in 2019.  The Government will pursue the operationalization of a forward planning job management system. The strategic thrusts of the Priority Action Plan of the National Employment Policy will continue to be implemented.
Access to vocational training will be improved by diversifying sectors and increasing training in new centres. The level of training will be improved through the establishment in Yaounde of the National Institute for Trainer Training and Programme Development.
What I have just said underscores the laudable efforts made by the Government to provide our youths with quality training and to facilitate their integration into working life.
My dear young compatriots,
The past few years have not been easy for our country in both the economic and security spheres. Thanks to the virtues of our people, particularly their courage and spirit of selflessness, we have not only overcome our challenges, but have also continued to forge ahead. Our youths can learn from this example.
In conclusion, I would like to remind you that challenges help to strengthen one’s resolve. For my part, rest assured that I am determined to pursue with you our common vision of a democratic, just and prosperous society. Such a society is possible only in a Cameroon that is united in its diversity.
I count on you.
Happy Youth Day to you all!
Long live Cameroonian youth!
Long live Cameroon!

Thanks to the courage of our population and the bravery of our Defence and Security Forces, the threat posed by Boko Haram in the Far-North Region has been significantly reduced. However, recent attacks by this terrorist group have shown the need to remain very vigilant.
The situation on our eastern border, especially in the Adamoua Region, also calls for our attention. Our population, particularly livestock breeders, are victims of criminal groups specialized in kidnapping for ransom. I have instructed our Defence and Security Forces to put an end to these criminal acts.
As I said recently, the situation in the North-West and South-West Regions is of utmost concern to me. Basing their actions on a secessionist pipe dream, armed groups have in recent months spread death and distress, killing, mutilating, and burning and destroying valuable infrastructure in these regions.
The people in these two regions are the main victims of the atrocities caused by these criminal groups.
I would like to assure them, once again, that the entire Nation stands by them in this hardship. It shares their concerns about their safety and their aspiration for a return to calm and normal social life. I will spare no effort to ensure that this legitimate aspiration becomes a reality.
Since the outbreak of this crisis, I have continued to seek ways and means of ensuring a peaceful solution. I will not review the long list of measures taken to that end.
The National Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration Committee that I recently set up is already at work. The initial contacts on the ground are encouraging. I once again appeal to our youths who allowed themselves to be lured into a dead end to get back on the right path, rebuild their lives and participate, alongside their other brothers and sisters, in nation-building.  As for those criminals who will persist on the path of violence, they know what awaits them. The Forces of Defence and Security will continue to discharge their duty with firmness, determination and professionalism.
Young Officers of the ""Unity and Diversity"" Batch,
It is within this context that you are joining the great family of defence forces. It is an honour for your families and you. I congratulate you.
I also wish to congratulate you on your decision to join the military profession, which is at the same time noble, demanding and exciting. It requires courage, self-denial and a sense of sacrifice.
The career you have just embraced requires you to observe strict discipline, display unfailing loyalty to republican institutions, be ever-ready to serve, and show complete dedication. Like your seniors who have distinguished themselves on the battlefield, I urge you to pursue the task of defending and protecting the Fatherland.
I also urge you to remain true to the values ​​that are the bedrock of our Nation and that guide the action of our Army. Together with your comrades, you will henceforth be the shield of your country. But, never forget that you are also expected to be the shield of our people. Strive to earn their respect and love through your courage, rectitude, self-denial, solicitude and professionalism. Such values ​​are as important as combat science.
Young Officers of the “Unity and Diversity” Batch,
Your batch name is fully justified in the current context. It reminds us not only of the very essence of our country and our Army, but also the foundation on which our Nation is being built.
Far from being a handicap, Cameroon’s cultural, linguistic and sociological diversity is indeed one of its most valuable assets. As a source of creativity and vitality, our diversity blends harmoniously with our desire to live together, to lay the groundwork for our constant quest for the consolidation our country’s unity. We do not only draw inspiration from our diversity, but also the determination and strength needed to meet our challenges.
Young Officers,
You hail from all the regions of Cameroon. Throughout your career, your batch name should serve as a spur, and also as a compass to help you never to lose sight of the imperative need for the defence of your country’s unity.
You will thus remain loyal to the memory of your elders who distinguished themselves brilliantly in preserving the peace and territorial integrity of our country. Many of them did not hesitate to make the supreme sacrifice in the defence of these ideals. I want to pay glowing tribute to them here and assure them that the Nation will ever be grateful to them.
Young Officers of the “Unity and Diversity” Batch,
On this memorable day and on behalf of the entire Nation, I am delighted to, once more, extend my hearty congratulations to you.
I wish to express my sincere gratitude to your civil and military instructors who accompanied you with dedication and competence throughout your training.
I also hail the success of your comrades who came from the Gabonese Republic, the Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic to undergo the same training with you. Their presence is testimony to the trust that exists between Cameroon and their respective countries. It is also a recognition of the quality of training provided by EMIA.
Young Officers,
Your career is now mapped out for you. You are called upon, from now on, to join in the great and noble struggle to defend our territorial integrity, national unity and republican institutions.
That is your duty.
That is your mission. It is sacred.
You will accomplish it with commitment and patriotism.
You will accomplish it with honour and fidelity, in keeping with the motto of our Army.
Draw inspiration from the self-denial and sense of sacrifice of your elders.
You can count on my constant solicitude and the unanimous support of the Cameroonian people.
Long live Cameroon’s Defence Forces!
And long live Cameroon!

Last year, on the same occasion, I asked the following question: “Can it be concluded that the tensions of the recent years are easing and that the world is entering a new era that is more conducive to economic and social progress?” I acknowledged, then, that it was too early to answer this question.
It is obvious that the question is in abeyance given the prevailing instability in international relations.
Although fighting in Syria and Iraq in the Near and Middle East is only sporadic, the future of the region will remain uncertain as long as the two major powers in the area do not reach a workable compromise, as illustrated by the situation in Yemen. Also, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict seems to have been “frozen” indefinitely.
It is difficult, under the prevailing conditions, to imagine how the major powers with predominant and conflicting influence and interests in the region could contribute to restoring stability.
Though defeated in the Near East, the Islamic State has activated its Jihadist cells in North Africa and in the Sahelian strip. Despite being held in check militarily, it still has an enormous capacity to cause harm in various African countries. Cameroon has had a bitter experience in its fight against Boko Haram.
Repelled beyond our borders, this terrorist movement now poses only a residual threat which, however, compels us to remain very vigilant. That is why we will maintain close collaboration with Lake Chad Basin Commission member countries which, in late November in Ndjamena and mid- December in Abuja, undertook to be on the alert.
The instability I mentioned earlier on has not only taken the form of tensions or armed conflicts. It is also the outcome of the calling into question of the post-World War II and Cold War balance of power which the United Nations and its Security Council were guarantors.
Over the last decades, this system of collective security can be credited with preventing the outbreak of a global conflict and, after several setbacks, enabling many newly independent countries to live in peace and embark on the development process. It is against this backdrop that the globalization of trade finally gained momentum.
Yet, very recently, nationalist tendencies have resurfaced around the world bringing about a two-pronged protest, namely:
- against multilateralism incarnated by the United Nations and accused, among other things, of sacrificing national interests  for allegedly “questionable” causes such as the fight against global warming;
- and against globalization which is accused of encouraging relocation and dumping and, hence, damaging the industrial heritage of some countries.
As expected, this renewed nationalism came along with protectionist measures, followed by negotiations or retaliatory measures.
Although for now it would be an overstatement to talk of a “trade war”, there is, however, concern that this trend may spread worldwide. We may thus be faced with a trade contradiction in which no one stands to gain, certainly not developing countries whose economies are heavily dependent on the outside world.
The recent G20 Summit held in Argentina showed that the major world economic powers were not indifferent to the consequences of protectionism. Apparently, a majority of them are in favour of free trade, although it is not clear if the issue has been resolved.
Such stiffening of trade relations has also affected the political domain. Thus, relations between the United States and Russia are strained over Crimea and Ukraine, and the 1987 US-Russia Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty which Washington intends to denounce.
Within NATO, the assignment of responsibilities and the design of a European defence system are controversial.
Indeed, the European Union is not spared by the nationalist tendency. Apart from Brexit whose consequences are still uncertain, there are henceforth two “blocs”: one composed mostly of Western countries that are proponents of integration; the other, comprising countries of former Eastern Europe, more inclined to a less restrictive federation. In such conditions, there is reason to worry over the future of the “European dream”.
The Asia-Pacific zone is also caught in cross-currents. Whereas the United States is trying to reconcile with North Korea, a laudable action though of concern for Tokyo and Seoul, China, for its part, is annoyed over what it considers an intrusion into its strategic sphere.
Regarding major multilateral issues, global warming remains a subject of spirited debates. Although a large majority of countries – including Cameroon – are still committed to COP21 decisions, implementation of the Paris Agreement is still dependent on the mobilization of huge amounts of resources, which implies intense negotiations. The latest of such negotiations which were held within the context of COP24 in Poland finally resulted to an agreement.
Migration has also continued to be an issue of passionate debate. We are all aware of the causal link between this phenomenon and the rise of populism. The United Nations Global Compact for safe Migration raised much hope. However, the Marrakech negotiations clearly showed that it met with resistance and that it failed to clarify many issues. In the meantime, the situation of migrants and refugees is still very alarming, despite the efforts made by the UNHCR.
All in all, it should be admitted that the rise of nationalism and populism has significantly changed the atmosphere of international relations. In Europe and North and South America, advocates of these ideologies have acceded to power. This will definitely have consequences on the balance of power on the planet. The writing is already on the wall. Will the new world be better than the old? That is the question.
For a country like Cameroon that exports raw materials whose prices are determined on foreign markets, it would no doubt be indispensable, as I have often said, to reduce its dependence on the outside world. Indeed, it will be necessary to carry out initial processing of its products, develop the industrial sector to reduce imports, stimulate trade which is still clearly insufficient within regional groupings and explore new markets in the rest of the world.
Whatever the circumstances, Cameroon will strive as much as possible to develop its trade with its traditional partners of the European Union. Similarly, we will pursue an active policy of economic cooperation with China, where I travelled to last March on a State visit and in September to attend the China-Africa Cooperation Forum. These visits confirmed the remarkable participation of this great friendly country in our development projects.
We will also seize all the opportunities offered by our excellent relations with Japan and the Republic of Korea, as well as with any country willing to forge mutually beneficial cooperation ties with us.
Moreover, we have, like in the past, maintained close ties with the African Union. We endeavoured to contribute to the reform of its institutions, which is expected to enhance integration and ensure its financial autonomy.
My country also had the pleasure of welcoming Mr Moussa Faki Mahamat, Chairman of the Commission of our continental organization. His visit was marked by the signing of headquarters agreements for the establishment of three pan-African institutions in Cameroon.
You would recall that last year, I deplored before you the fact that the spirit of conciliation is on the wane on the global scene. In this regard, the situation does not seem to have improved significantly.
As scientific and technological advancement is endowing humanity with more and more extraordinary powers each day, will the “new world” that is being heralded take a wrong turn and revert to the divisions and quarrels of yesteryear? Our future depends on it. May common sense prevail.
I would now like to request you to kindly convey our best wishes for the New Year to the distinguished authorities that you represent.
I extend to you and your families my most sincere wishes for happiness, health and success in 2019.
Long live international cooperation!
Thank you for your kind attention.

My dear compatriots,
The seven-year term that has just begun should be decisive for our country. It could even be one of the most defining moments of our post-independence history.
Let me explain.
During the past half-century that has just ended, we progressively established democratic institutions. We strove to maintain security throughout our territory. We made every effort to switch from an obsolete economic model to a more modern system that is more consistent with our national interest.
Of course, this was a long haul. Some objectives, such as the establishment of democracy, were achieved. Those related to security were only partly achieved, due to serious internal and external threats. Lastly, others, the most ambitious ones which aimed to transform our society, were implemented patiently.
Unforeseen difficulties compounded our task. In the 1980s, the sharp deterioration of terms of trade jeopardized our progress. Ten years later, the global economic and financial crisis put a stop to our momentum and slowed down our growth. More recently, falling oil and commodity prices had the same impact.
However, we did not give up. In the face of adversity, we designed a three-phase development strategy: greater achievements, major accomplishments and great opportunities. We hope that this last phase will steer us to the threshold of emergence.
It is perhaps not futile to clarify what we mean by emergence. Generally, the term refers to an improvement in a situation. As commonly understood, it means the transition from an underdeveloped to a developed country. This is our meaning of the term and that is why I instructed that it should be considered as a “national cause”.
I believe that the coming years will be decisive regarding the achievement of this objective. To that end, we will have to get down to three key tasks, namely restore security, enhance our economic growth and significantly improve the living conditions of Cameroonians.
Given that the situation in the Far-North has been stabilized and on our eastern border brought under control, I will focus on the situation in the North-West and South-West Regions.
Recently, I had the opportunity to express myself regarding the issues concerning them. I stated and I reaffirm my deepest concern for the populations of these two regions. I am very sensitive to their worries about their safety and their aspirations for a return to calm and normal social life.
If my appeal to warmongers to lay down their weapons remains unheeded, the Defence and Security Forces will be instructed to neutralize them. I am well aware of the distress these rebels are causing the populations of these regions. This situation cannot be allowed to continue.
In a spirit of national harmony, I decided to set up a “National Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration Committee” to avoid the use of extreme measures. The duties of this body, which is under the authority of the Prime Minister, are to organize, supervise and manage the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants of Boko Haram and armed groups in the North-West and South-West Regions willing to respond favourably to the hand of peace extended to them.
I wish to emphasize that this initiative provides a dignified way out for ex-combatants and prospects for social reintegration, and should pave the way for a return to calm and normalcy.
On the other hand, measures will be taken as soon as possible to give the local communities of our country the powers that would enable them to play a greater role in the management of local affairs. At the same time, the promotion of bilingualism and multiculturalism will be fast-tracked.
Furthermore, I intend to continue the dialogue initiated with people of good-will to bring about lasting peace.
Paradoxically, one of the effects of the unfortunate events that have been affecting social life in the North-West and South-West Regions for months now may surprise many of us. The populations of these two regions have noticed the sincerity of the intentions of authorities concerning the new powers delegated to local communities and the solidarity of the rest of the Nation towards them. My wish is that, eventually, national unity will be strengthened.
Earlier on, I mentioned the external factors that slowed down our economic growth. Our economy is gradually recovering thanks to the measures we have taken. However, we will have to redouble our efforts to stay on the path of emergence.
Without going into details of our projects which I talked about recently, I would like to simply recall that one of our priorities should be the modernization of our agriculture by meeting its production and diversification targets, and providing it with the required technical resources. The broad outline of this “agricultural revolution” was defined at the Ebolowa Agricultural Show and is still relevant.
The same is true for our major industrialization project which should be implemented in line with the orientations of our Master Plan. Its priority should be the processing of our agricultural commodities to give them value added and reduce our imports of goods and services.
We will continue to provide our country with energy infrastructure to meet the needs of our agro-industry and various industrial sectors, as well as the demands of our people. In addition to hydroelectric dams, solar energy plants will be constructed for rural electrification.
The remarkable efforts that have already been made to develop our transport infrastructure (roads, motorways, ports and airports) will be continued to boost our economy and ease the mobility of our compatriots.
Furthermore, by concluding an economic and financial arrangement with the International Monetary Fund in 2017 under the “Extended Credit Facility”, we undertook to pursue the implementation of our structural reforms, maintain our fiscal balance and ensure the sustainability of our external debt.
It is against this backdrop that we will have to finance our major projects. To that end, we will need to increasingly resort to financial institutions that apply more accessible concessional lending rates. It is inadmissible that our projects should take much more time to mature than in countries of a comparable level of development. Maturation periods of time should be reduced.
Some of our problems stem from the fact that the structures of our economy make us to depend heavily on the external world, especially the prices of our commodities. I have often said that we are in a position to produce most of what we import, be it agricultural or industrial products. It is absolutely necessary to take this into account. We have no choice in the face of growing protectionism.
In the same vein, it is necessary for us to do more to incorporate digital progress into the functioning of our public services and our economy. The developing digital society will not wait for laggards.
Significant progress has already been made in that connection over the past decades. More effort will be  required to build a society that ensures equal opportunity and decent living conditions for the entire population.
We will therefore continue to:
- extend a system of quality education at all levels by focusing on professionalization;
- build more health centres, extend our network of referral hospitals and finance our social security scheme;
- solve the nagging problem of low-cost housing;
- further improve access to drinking water and electricity, including in rural areas;
- and, lastly, promote the role of women and youths in our society.
In so doing, we will eventually roll back poverty which is the source of the diverse exclusions still existing in our country.
A problem of particular concern to me is still to be addressed. I am referring to unemployment, especially among youths. Naturally, the government services responsible for addressing the issue will do what is expected of them. However, it should be acknowledged that this social ill which is affecting most countries on the planet is closely linked to the level of economic activity, in other words growth.
That is why we will do all we can to encourage and boost the growth rebound we are currently experiencing.
Fellow Cameroonians,
My dear compatriots,
That is the triple challenge we are facing. I have no doubt that we will overcome it if we remain united, supportive and committed.
As you are aware, our country was poised to host the great African football jamboree in 2019. Based on certain information, the African Football Confederation decided that the date should be shifted. We have taken note of the decision. As I have already said, all investments relating to the organization of AFCON will be carried out. I avail myself of this opportunity to urge you to remain mobilized to ensure the eventual construction of our road, railway, hospital and sports infrastructure for this major event: our country deserves it indeed.
My dear compatriots,
Believe me, in these difficult moments, I am devoting all my energy and all my experience to ensuring peace, unity and progress in our beloved and beautiful country.
I count on each and every one of you to help me in this endeavour.
I wish you all a happy and prosperous 2019.
Long live the Republic!
Long live Cameroon!

I also wish, before you, once again, to thank the Cameroonian people for having renewed their trust in me. Such trust will represent an invaluable support to me in the discharge of the weighty responsibilities awaiting me in the years ahead.
The oath I have just taken “before the people”, in accordance with the provisions of Article 7 of our Constitution, in the presence of their representatives, is of a highly symbolic significance on two counts:
- it is an expression of absolute loyalty to the institutions of the Republic from which I cannot derogate; and
- it is an irrevocable personal commitment to performing the duties of Head of State as set forth in our Constitution.
As in the past, these principles will guide my action in serving the Cameroonian people during the seven-year term of “Great Opportunities” beginning today.
Before outlining our prospects, I would like us to take a quick look back so that we can take stock of the present situation.
The seven-year term that has just ended was not a bed of roses.
Security wise, we first had to deal with repeated attacks by the terrorist group, Boko Haram, which spread terror and desolation in the far-north of our country. Together with our neighbours, and with the help of our traditional partners, we responded strongly. Our defence and security forces, to whom I once more pay tribute, chased the enemy out of our borders. The situation is now stable, but we remain vigilant and determined.
Then, in the North-West and South-West Regions, negative forces thought they could take advantage of socio-professional grievances to try to roll out a secessionist agenda. This was followed by successive acts of terrorist violence to which the Government responded by taking the necessary measures to ensure public law and order, as well the safety of people and their property.
It is obvious that the secessionist ambition undermines our Constitution which establishes the “indivisible” nature of our Republic.
On the other hand, our population’s repeated desire to be more closely involved in the management of their local affairs prompted us to take necessary measures to fast-track the decentralization process.
These priority tasks did not distract us from the need to work towards improving our economy, adversely impacted by the global economic and financial crisis, as well as falling commodity prices.
To that end, we continued implementing our structural reforms and taking measures to improve our fiscal situation. Our “resilience” was hailed by the IMF with which we concluded, in 2017, an economic and financial programme backed by an “extended credit facility”. It is clear that these efforts account for our progressive return to growth.
At the same time, while ensuring the sustainability of our external debt, we gave a fresh impetus to our major infrastructure projects regarding power generation, drinking water supply and road construction. This is evident in the many achievements recorded.  
Despite the adverse economic situation, many projects were initiated in the health, education and social services sectors. Unquestionably, considerable progress has been achieved in this regard.
Furthermore, we pursued efforts to complete the building of     our institutional and democratic edifice with the effective setting up of the Senate and the Constitutional Council.
Against all odds, we have, thus, stayed the course towards emergence.
This quick review, which is far from exhaustive, clearly shows that our country is undergoing transformation and that it is resolutely set on the path of progress.
Overall, during the seven-year term which is starting, we will strive to consolidate our achievements, while exploring new avenues that will enable us to make use of all the opportunities offered by an ever-changing world.
In this light, we will naturally pursue our structural reforms to consolidate our fiscal balance and bolster our debt sustainability. A healthy financial situation is a sine qua non for economic and, hence, investment attractiveness.
In this regard, I would like to draw your attention to ongoing changes taking place on the world scene and which are bound to have an impact on our country.
The decades-old rules which have governed globalization of trade are being challenged. Indeed, protectionist and even isolationist tendencies are gaining ground.  These trends portray the obvious risk of a destabilizing effect on many countries, particularly developing countries like ours. We will increasingly suffer the effects of climate change which will impact the lives of our fellow citizens, notably rural dwellers.
In this regard, I think it is worthwhile for us to strive to develop the sectors of our economy that could significantly reduce our imports of goods and services. Such policy will have the advantage of enabling us to balance our chronic trade deficit.
Moreover, we will stage a veritable “agricultural revolution” by modernizing our production tools and further processing our agricultural products. This should be accompanied by the acquisition of new equipment and the construction of warehouses and access roads. Our status as breadbasket of Central Africa could thus be consolidated.
There can be no modern economy without an efficient industrial sector. We have an Industrialization Master Plan that presents the outline and content of a major project in this area. Its implementation will be among the priority tasks to be performed during the seven-year term.
Industry and agriculture require stable and sufficient power supply. We have been making significant efforts in this sector for some time now. The hydropower dams and plants that we have constructed should enable us, sooner or later, to fully meet the demands of our economy and our population’s energy needs.
However, we will not stop at that. We will continue to exploit all the available sites and rivers in order to transform Cameroon into a major electricity producer on our continent. We will also pay attention to rural areas by progressively providing them with solar energy plants.
Similarly, we will continue to develop our transport infrastructure (roads, ports, airports) to boost our economy and facilitate communication with our neighbours.
Bearing in mind that the ultimate goal of democracy is to provide the greatest number of people with the best living conditions possible and real equal opportunities, I will continue to devote all my efforts to:
- fostering economic growth that creates jobs, particularly for  youths, and which can increase purchasing power;
- promoting the role of women in our society;
- facilitating the social integration of youths by further developing our educational system at all levels and focusing on professionalization;
- fighting against exclusion, notably by providing better protection to persons with disabilities;
- improving access to public drinking water and electricity utilities;
- enhancing our health system by building new hospitals and finalizing an efficient social security system;
- developing a worthwhile  social housing policy;
- developing our cultural heritage;
- and, lastly, providing the sports sector with the support that it deserves, in the hope that the efforts that we have made to host AFCON 2019 will be rightly rewarded.
The major challenges that must be met to ensure the emergence of our economy, which I have mentioned, and the commitments that I have made to improve the quality of life for Cameroonians, require, first of all, the creation of conditions conducive to stability and security. Rest assured that I will see to it that it so happens.
The goal of achieving emergence must become a major national cause rallying all our fellow citizens in order transform Cameroon into a modern and socially advanced country.
Public servants and private sector workers have a vital role to play in this regard. I am aware of their difficulties. I will take the necessary measures to improve their working conditions, in order to enable them contribute more to our country’s progress.  
Before concluding, I want to stress that I deeply reflected over the frustrations and aspirations of the vast majority of our compatriots in the North-West and South-West Regions. A good number of these concerns and aspirations will be addressed as part of current efforts to accelerate the decentralization process. Measures will be taken as soon as possible to broaden the powers of local authorities in order to provide them with the means for greater autonomy.
Bilingualism and multiculturalism will continue to be promoted by the commission set up to that end.
These actions and others will be undertaken to resolve the many problems that are at the root of the frustrations and dissatisfaction that have been expressed in recent times. It is our hope that this will restore calm that is indispensable for a return to normalcy and usual economic activity. I am deeply convinced that the overwhelming majority of our compatriots in the two regions concerned aspire to a rapid return to peace within the national community.
Unfortunately, as a result of the threats that the secessionists keep brandishing in this part of our country, many of them were unable to exercise their right to vote during the recent presidential election and thereby express their attachment to our national unity. I call on them not to lose hope and to lend all possible support to the action of the authorities aimed at restoring peace. They know, better than anyone, what their life would be like under the yoke of extremists who have been spreading terror and desolation in their regions for some months now.
These war-mongers who are jeopardizing our national unity and preaching secession should know that they will face not only the full force of the law, but also the determination of our defence and security forces. I am calling on them to lay down their arms and get back on the right track. I am appealing particularly to youths who got involved in a futile adventure.
I have no doubt whatsoever that the destiny of our compatriots in the North-West and South-West lies within our Republic. With the support of the Cameroonian people as a whole and convinced that  there is an honourable way out in everyone’s interest, I will strive to restore peace and calm in the two regions concerned, with due respect for the institutions of which I am guarantor.
Turning to my young compatriots now, I would like to ask you not to lose hope. I have understood your deep aspiration for change that will open the door to the future and enable your complete personal fulfilment. I have also understood your desire for greater participation in taking decisions that concern the destiny of our country. I will take this into account bearing in mind that tomorrow’s Cameroon will be built with your input.
By staying united and proud of its democratic, economic and social advances, our country will confidently embrace progress and modernity.
That is why, here and now, I am calling on the Cameroonian people, who I know to be patriotic, to help me to continue the task of nation-building in peace.
Long-live the Republic!
Long-live Cameroon!

Permit me, first of all, to thank you and, through you, the Far-North for the symbolic gifts that have been presented to my wife and to me.
The Governor of the Far-North Region,
The Government Delegate to the Maroua City Council,
The Chairperson of the Far-North Regional Campaign Coordination,
 Traditional and Religious Authorities,
Dear Compatriots of the Far-North,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Permit me, first of all, to thank the Government Delegate to the Maroua City Council for his warm words of welcome. They are an expression of the deep ties binding me to the population of the Far-North whose support I have always enjoyed.
My thanks also go to the Chairperson of the Far-North Regional Campaign Coordination for the kind words he has just spoken about me and my wife. Our relations have always been full of frank cordiality and trust. Thank you for your warm welcome.
My dear compatriots of the Far-North,
Thank you for turning out so massively to welcome me here in Maroua. You have braved the sun, the heat and distance to meet me. I heartily thank you.
Thank you for all your tokens of friendship and fraternal attachment which are a clear reflection of your region’s beautiful traditions of hospitality and loyalty.
My choice to come to Maroua on campaign is an expression of the high esteem I have for your region and my commitment to making it benefit from the “great opportunities” that our country currently offers.
Over the past few years, you have been at the forefront. And you have stood your ground.
Faced with a barbaric invader that destroyed, burnt and killed, you resisted as best you could. You stood by our defence and security forces. The vigilante groups played a key role in your resistance.
Now that the enemy has been repelled beyond our borders, we have to reconstruct, facilitate the return of displaced persons and do all in our power to recreate conditions for normal administrative, academic, economic and social life.
However, we need to remain vigilant as the terrorists have not given up planning suicide attacks that are difficult to prevent.
My dear compatriots of the Far-North,
Now that the threat is receding, we will be facing an exalting task in no distant future. It is a matter of winning the development struggle together, no more no less.
And you have the wherewithal.
In the area of energy, the old hydroelectric dams will be upgraded. Others will be commissioned. Solar facilities, which are easier to build, will supplement them. Therefore, you will have the energy that is indispensable for rural electrification and for running your industries.
There is every indication that your subsoil abounds in minerals and oil. It will be necessary to give fresh impetus to prospecting and, subsequently, drilling.
Some of your land is fertile and suitable for large-scale farming of industrial crops such as, depending on the area, rice and cotton whose acreages need to be extended.
We will thus reduce food shortages and expand our textile industry to its rightful scale, with predictable employment spinoffs.
I should also mention your vast expanses of land suitable for livestock, milk and meat production, as well as cereal cultivation. These various items bear great development potential.
Once peace is consolidated everywhere, tourism in your region will also need to be given a second chance. Our parks and reserves have not lost an iota of their attractiveness.
All of this will require building infrastructure - roads, bridges, warehouses, cold stores, etc. - which we sometimes lack.    
And why not say it: is it unrealistic to think that in the very near future, a railway line will link N’Gaoundere and N’djamena through Kousseri? I don’t think so. I will let you imagine the impact of such an achievement for your region and for trade with our neighbours.
Rest assured that I will not lose sight of these problems.
My dear compatriots of the Far-North,
The coming years will be crucial for Cameroon and particularly for your region.
We have been through many ordeals to get where we are. Most of them were imposed on us by the global environment: the 2008 crisis, the drop in oil and commodity prices, especially.
Others stem from our immediate surroundings, such as attacks by Boko Haram or incursions into our eastern border by armed gangs.
Lastly, there are those resulting from the insecurity caused by a secessionist movement in our North-West and South-West Regions.
I think I can safely state that we have overcome the toughest of these ordeals. However, we still need to restore peace in our North-West and South-West Regions, ravaged by acts of violence perpetrated by secessionists. By meeting the legitimate expectations of our compatriots in the two regions and by protecting them against excesses by the so-called liberators, we will prove that their future is truly within our Republic.
We will then continue to forge ahead by seizing all the “great opportunities” open to us. To this end, we will need to remain united, demonstrate solidarity, juggle firmness and dialogue, and remain faithful to our democratic ideal.
Under such circumstances, I think nothing will be able to distract our great and beautiful Nation from its path to prosperity and social progress.
Come 7 October, I know I can count on you to make the choice that will keep you on the side of “the force of experience”.
Long live the Far-North Region!
Long live the Republic!
Long live Cameroon!

https://prc.cm/en/news/speeches-of-the-president/2675-testen,/en/news/speeches-of-the-president/2675-testen,"My dear young compatriots,
The last few years have not been easy for our country, which has had to take up simultaneously several major challenges, namely:
-     addressing the Boko Haram threat in our northern regions and that of armed gangs on our eastern border;
-     hosting tens of thousands of refugees and displaced persons;
-     managing the outburst of unrest in the North-West and South-West Regions, marked by sporadic  acts of violence; and
-     countering the impact of falling oil and commodity prices in a bid to return to growth.
I believe we can now make an initial appraisal of our struggles on these different fronts:
-     Boko Haram’s potential to cause harm has been severely undermined, thanks to the combined action of Cameroon’s  defence forces and its people;
-     supportive measures have enabled many displaced persons and refugees to return to their homes;
-     the situation in the South-West and North-West Regions is stabilizing, and the Commission for the Promotion of Bilingualism and Multiculturalism should thus be able to delve into the crux of the problem;
-     the latest assessments point to an improvement in our economy, with renewed activity in various sectors.
Indeed, the characteristic ""resilience"" of the Cameroonian people deserves to be hailed once again, for, it must be stated, credit for the results we have achieved goes to the people. Not only did they not give up, but they lent their support to   government’s action.
Our compatriots at large, regardless of social status, remained united throughout the ordeals. And such is what makes a great nation.
Allow me, once again, to underscore the heroism of our defence and security forces - mostly young people - whose sense of duty and responsibility has been beyond all praise.
My dear young compatriots,
The Nation is calling on you strongly, because, in the decades ahead, you will be our country’s leaders, hence the need for you to be up to the task, by acquiring the necessary skills and experience.
However, first, you must understand that the ""new world” which is unfolding before our very own eyes could be tougher and more unstable than the old one. The rules that governed the old world for more than half a century - the role of the United Nations in maintaining world peace, international trade regulation, solidarity through development assistance, etc. - could become more difficult to apply, whereas nationalism, protectionism and isolationism are likely to gain ground.
In a tougher and less open world, it could become more difficult for developing countries to defend their interests and secure their economic and social progress.
Accordingly, we should commend the holding of events such as the recent African Union / European Union Summit in Abidjan, which focused on youth education and training in Africa and particularly the acquisition of new technologies and modernization of agriculture.
These orientations are in line with the objectives of China’s ""new silk road"" initiative and the development assistance projects of Asian countries such as India, Japan and South Korea. So, there are reasons to not yield to pessimism.
While Cameroon may rely on the solidarity of its external partners, as well as the understanding of major international organizations, the fact remains that its own efforts are naturally foremost.
Indeed, this is not the business of the government alone, but that of each and every one of us. And, in this regard, I will echo the famous quote: “Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.”
Today, I renew this call for effort which I made to you barely a year ago on the same occasion. Rather than yielding to the tempting mirage of illegal emigration and undertaking a hazardous   and often doomed trip,        I invite you to play an active part in our great vision to achieve emergence by 2035.
I believe I can safely say that the State has done much in recent years to prepare you for this lofty task.
Regarding the budget, the combined allocations of the three ministries responsible for education represent about 15% of public spending. Great strides have been or are being made in terms of infrastructure, school facilities and educational opportunities.
The number of schools and universities is growing progressively, the two most recent illustrations thereof being the opening of a Faculty of Medicine in Garoua and a Higher Teachers’ Training College in Bertoua.
Today, each of our ten regions has a public higher education institution. Moreover, from this year on, our universities will be connected to the global university cyberspace.
The programme to donate computers to our students, which will be pursued actively, will help them to more easily connect thereto and access more and more knowledge and resources.
The government’s policy, geared towards learning trades as well as vocational and technical training, is beginning to pay off as it fosters self-employment and the socio-economic integration of youths.
As at 31 December 2017, 473,303 (four hundred and seventy-three thousand three hundred and three) jobs had been identified for youths, exceeding our set target of 400,000 (four hundred thousand). We are however aware that more jobs are required to curb youth unemployment.
Moreover, although growth slowed down due to exogenous factors, we continued forging ahead in various sectors of our development. The year 2018 will mark the completion of our major first-generation projects such as:
-     the hydroelectric dams that will soon be supplemented by power transmission infrastructure;
-     road projects such as Douala City’s east and west entryways, the second bridge over the Wouri River, various highways and the motorways under construction.
Already, a series of projects known as second-generation projects have been launched or are in the pipeline. They concern energy generation, new road transport infrastructure and especially the extension of our railroad network to N'Djamena and Limbe. We will then have to devise an ambitious social housing strategy commensurate with our needs.
Our GESP-based development programme will be continued, as will the three-year ""special youth"" plan which, since its inception last year, has  prioritized youth access to agriculture, industry, handicrafts, the digital economy and innovation. Nearly 500,000 youths have already registered with the National Youth Observatory to participate in the aforementioned youth plan. As funding has already been secured, its implementation will be accelerated in 2018.
The year 2018 will also be a decisive one for the preparation of AFCON 2019. The State has pumped considerable resources into it. It will then be up to our footballers to live up to their reputation and the outstanding achievements of their illustrious predecessors. They have demonstrated in the past that they are up to the task.
My dear young compatriots,
From my position as Head of State, I perceive signs of your growing interest in public affairs.
In this regard, your favourite platform of expression is the social media. Whenever at a click, you access these communication highways that give you global visibility, you must bear in mind that you are not exempted from fulfilling civic and moral obligations, such as respect for others and your country’s institutions. Be patriotic Internet users working for Cameroon’s development and influence, and not passive followers or naive relays for staunch critics of the Republic.
The Cameroon of tomorrow, which is being forged before our very own eyes, will differ almost entirely from that of yesteryear. You will be its key beneficiaries. You will need to prove yourselves worthy of it.
The world is about to witness a dramatic change. The populations of most developed countries are aging. Africa, on the contrary, will be a continent of predominantly young people by the middle of the century.
This constitutes both an opportunity and a challenge. Let us seize the opportunity and meet the challenge. I believe our youths are capable of doing so.
A final word. As you know, 2018 will be an important election year. You all who will be aged 20 years and above will be able to - or rather should - exercise your right to vote. By voting, you will be performing an act of responsible citizenship and, thus, participating in forging your destiny.
Happy Youth Day to each and every one!
Long Live Cameroon’s Youth!
Long Live Cameroon!

I would, first of all, like to thank you for your very kind and encouraging words to my wife and I and, above all, to the Cameroonian people whose courage and peace-loving nature you have kindly emphasized.
Distinguished Members of the Diplomatic Corps,
As we receive news of the last battles against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria and as signs of global economic recovery begin to show, can it be concluded that the tensions of the recent years are easing and that the world is entering a new era that is more conducive to economic and social progress?
It is certainly too early to answer this question. However, nothing prevents us from examining, together, various aspects of the issue thus raised.
Admittedly, the Islamic State seems to have been defeated. However, it has left in its trail latent seeds of insurgency. Moreover, many jihadists have returned to their countries of origin where they are a potential danger.
Similarly, the rivalry between the two most powerful countries in the region will remain a destabilizing factor for the entire region, not to mention the Israeli-Palestinian problem that seems to have dampened every ounce of goodwill and thus remains unresolved. Consequently, the Near and Middle East region is likely to remain a ​​potential conflict area.
By the way, jihadists had already extended their activities to North Africa and the Sahelian strip well before the defeat of the Islamic State. Under such names as AQIM, Boko Haram and al-Shabaab, jihadism has been and remains a threat to various African States. Despite the blows it has been dealt, it is still a source of danger to the independence and social model of those countries.
Concerning Cameroon, the threat has been averted thanks to the bravery of our defence and security forces and the Multinational Joint Task Force supported by the African Union and our international partners.
However, we must remain vigilant. While the United Nations and major world powers have become fully aware of the threat, a global strategy is still to be developed to provide a final solution.
On the economic front, I believe we must salute the signs of a return to growth. However, it should be noted that the situation is not the same everywhere.
Some countries are already experiencing growth, driven by substantial injections of liquidity and very low interest rates, while others, despite a drastic fall in exports, are still recording high growth rates, mainly thanks to strong domestic demand. Some countries are still struggling to get back to growth, while others, like Cameroon, have adopted a structural reform agenda as falling oil and commodity prices have slowed down growth.
In this regard, it is necessary to underscore the importance of the recent CEMAC summits held in Yaounde and N’djamena, which emphasized the need to accelerate sub-regional integration.
The main goal is a return to economic growth. In our case, we will spare no effort within our power to implement the programme and remain focused on our agenda of achieving emergence by 2035.
The very contrasting situation I have just painted makes it rather presumptuous to prejudge the probable outlook of the world’s economy. Growing inequality is fuelling the rise of populism and nationalism.
These phenomena, which can be observed especially in some developed countries, have led to the protectionist and isolationist tendencies that have been gaining ground for some time now. It is obvious that if such phenomena become more widespread, we may witness a veritable regression of trade, with all its attendant negative effects on both developed and developing countries.
Fortunately, we have not yet reached that stage. The most positive outcome would obviously be to hold international negotiations that would seek to find middle ground between protectionism and wanton globalization. It would indeed be desirable to reach a compromise, combining the recognized advantages of globalization with the protection of national interests.
A while ago, I said nationalism was again on the rise in our times. When nationalism is taken to mean love for one’s nation, it is tolerable. But when, as is often the case, nationalism is defined in opposition to other nations, its essence changes and it becomes dangerous. The same is true of regionalism. However, there is a growing trend of centrifugal forces that call the unity of either old or new States into question.
In my opinion, splintering runs in the opposite direction of history. Globalization implies forming groups to promote harmony and solidarity among the members of the human community and ensure their protection. Such is the case with international and regional organizations and, even more so, with States.
As a former mandated and trust territory of the League of Nations and the United Nations respectively, Cameroon is a fervent supporter of our common International Organization and its initiatives to promote peace, development and environmental protection.
Having observed that global warming is persisting and that its effects are becoming increasingly obvious, judging from the frequency of natural disasters, my country, which was one of the first to ratify the Paris Agreement, considers that the commitments made at COP 21 must be honoured. Cameroon supports the efforts made to this end at COP 22 in Marrakech and at COP 23 in Bonn, and most recently in Paris. We must bear in mind that it is the fate of humanity that is at stake.
Speaking specifically of humanity, I would like to express compassion for migrants and refugees, whether fleeing fighting in the Middle East or embarking on perilous adventures from sub-Saharan Africa to Europe in search of a better future. They are locked up in camps, huge sums of money are extorted from them to get a place on makeshift boats, and they are even sold as slaves. Do these people not have the right to be treated as human beings?
At their recent joint summit in Abidjan, the African Union and the European Union charted the way forward. But when will the international community really come together to take action and put an end to what will undoubtedly go down in history as one of the greatest scandals of the 21st century?
As far as Cameroon is concerned, we deployed our diplomatic activities throughout the world.
High-level contacts were made:
with the President of the Italian Republic and His Holiness Pope Francis in Rome,
with CEMAC Heads of State at the N'djamena Summit,
with the United Nations Secretary-General in New York and Yaounde,
with the Heads of State present in Abidjan at the African Union-European Union Summit, and
with Heads of State at the 12 December 2017 One Planet Summit in Paris on financing the Climate Agreement.
From the foregoing, I can confidently say that our country is living up to its billing.
Last but not least, the most recent visit by the Right Honourable Patricia Scotland, Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, was an opportunity for us to show our attachment to that esteemed institution and to brief our august guest on the realities of our country. I must note that her visit to Cameroon at this time of our history was most welcome.
Before concluding, I would like to revisit a point to which I attach some importance. Until recently, it seemed to me that there had been some consensus on the need to seek, as far as possible, acceptable solutions to disputes between powers and to problems that put the interests of the international community as a whole at stake. In this respect, I seemed to see some degree of mutual trust among a majority of States.
However, I have the impression that things have changed somewhat and that the spirit of consensus has waned. Opposition is more radical and the quest for compromise is less present. Yet, since 1945, the world has experienced the longest period of widespread peace in modern history. Hunger, poverty and epidemics have reduced. Exclusion is no longer a fatality. Obviously, there is still a lot to do. That is why it is absolutely necessary to secure renewed trust between nations and for the spirit of conciliation to take its rightful place.
The Dean of the Diplomatic Corps,
Distinguished Members of the Diplomatic Corps,
I would now like to request you to kindly convey our best wishes for the New Year to the distinguished authorities that you represent here.
I extend to you and your families my most sincere wishes for happiness, health and success in 2018.
Long live international cooperation!
Thank you for your kind attention.

My Dear Compatriots,
During the year just ending, Cameroon confirmed to the world, within a difficult context, the soundness of its institutions, the resilience of its economy and its attachment to national unity.
Indeed, our country demonstrated a remarkable capacity to meet the numerous challenges it faced in the sporting, security, economic or social domains.
Credit for such accomplishments goes first and foremost to you, the Cameroonian people! An overwhelming majority of you, whether from the North or South, East or West; whether Anglophone or Francophone, have always demonstrated courage, dynamism, patriotism and, above all, maturity.
Congratulations to you!
My Dear Compatriots,
The adverse global economic situation due notably to falling commodity prices has negatively impacted economic growth and social progress in our country. It has also caused cash flow problems which have severely affected Government contractors, particularly small-and medium-size enterprises.
As part of its efforts to address this situation, in June 2017, the Government concluded an economic and financial programme with the International Monetary Fund backed by an “Extended Credit Facility”. This programme is expected to have a positive impact on our growth as from 2018.
To this end, we will maintain our efforts to optimize public revenue collection and streamline public spending. Special attention will be paid to the situation of SMEs especially in terms of settling the   debt owed them and improving their access to bank loans.
We will also maintain our resolve to   implement our major projects, with a special focus on road infrastructure. Community outreach services, notably water, electricity and health care will be given special attention.
Our country’s health map is getting denser each year, with the construction of about one hundred health centres, subdivisional medical centres and district hospitals.
We will continue our efforts to provide quality and universal health care to our population. In this regard, I have instructed the Government to finalize discussions on ways to progressively establish a universal health coverage system.
Remarkable progress has been achieved in implementing the projects included in the Three-year Emergency Plan. These are projects which foster true social progress within our communities. Such efforts will be continued.
The Government’s sustained action to increase the number of schools and universities make Cameroon a major pool of quality human resources in Africa. Similarly, we will step up our efforts to create jobs, particularly for our youth. In this regard, the completion of major projects such as the Port of Kribi, which will soon go operational, opens up bright prospects.
The IMF review mission fielded from October to November 2017 rightly hailed the resilience of our economy and our performance in implementing the programme concluded with this institution. This, you will agree with me, augurs well for our goal of achieving emergence.
My Dear Compatriots,
In the sports domain, the year which is drawing to a close brought us great victories which should be hailed. Our Football Indomitable Lions brilliantly lifted their fifth continental trophy. Our National Women’s Volleyball Team did us proud by emerging as the African Champion right here in Yaounde. On various stadiums worldwide, our flag was raised high and our national anthem resounded thanks to our sportsmen and sportswomen. The Cameroonian Nation, through me, extends its hearty congratulations to them.
As you are aware, in 2019, our country will host the large continental football family on the occasion of the Africa Cup of Nations. Beyond the purely sporting aspect, this will avail us an opportunity to offer our guests Cameroon’s warm hospitality. I have no doubt that, like our athletes, our population will rise to the occasion and showcase Cameroon at its best.
Our country will be ready for this grand celebration of friendship. I have made a commitment to that end.
My Dear Compatriots,
The issue of security was not the least of the challenges Cameroon had to address   in 2017.
The Boko Haram terrorist sect continued its attacks against our country. Thanks to the bravery of our soldiers and the courage of our population, we inflicted heavy losses on this criminal group and annihilated its expansionist dreams. Definitely, vigilance remains the watchword. In collaboration with our neighbours and international partners, we will sustain our efforts to totally eradicate this terrorist group.   
We also scored remarkable victories combating hostage-taking on our eastern border. We will step up efforts in that regard, and relentlessly track down the criminal groups involved.
In the North-West and South-West Regions, socio-professional grievances, which the Government nonetheless strove to address adequately, were exploited by extremists seeking to impose their secessionist plans through violence.
We all witnessed the seriousness of the spillover. The symbols of the Republic were desecrated. Our children’s education was compromised by criminal arsonists who did not hesitate to burn down schools and attack students. Economic and social activities were disrupted by irresponsible strike calls imposed on the population through threats, intimidation and violence. Bomb attacks were carried out. Many of our compatriots lost their lives in violence perpetrated by secessionists.  Members of our defence and security forces were assassinated in cold blood in the line of duty.
I would like to invite you to spare a thought for all our fellow citizens who lost their lives in this crisis. On behalf of the entire Nation, I would also like to extend our heartfelt condolences to all the bereaved families.
As I reminded you recently, it is my duty to ensure republican order, social peace, the unity of the Nation and Cameroon’s integrity.
In this regard, I have issued instructions that all those who have taken up arms, who perpetrate or encourage violence should be fought relentlessly and held accountable for their crimes before the courts of law.
The security operations conducted to that end have already yielded excellent results. They will continue unabated, but without excesses. I congratulate the defence and security forces on the bravery, determination, restraint and professionalism they have demonstrated thus far.
I am aware that the wish of every Cameroonian of good will is to see an end to tensions in the North-West and South-West Regions and a return to normalcy. The vast majority of Cameroonians aspire to live together in peace.
Bearing in mind this aspiration, I set up the National Commission for the Promotion of Bilingualism and Multiculturalism which will play a key role in promoting our togetherness.
It is in the same light that, at the onset of the crisis, I requested the Government to engage in a constructive dialogue with English-speaking teachers and lawyers to seek solutions to their demands. The Government took many actions following the dialogue, even going beyond the initial demands. Others are ongoing or in the pipeline.
I should make it very clear that, to my mind, dialogue has always been and will always remain the best means of resolving problems, so long as it is strictly in line with republican legality.
My Dear Compatriots,
My conviction that our fellow citizens desire greater participation in managing their affairs, especially at the local level, has been strengthened by the consultations I have held and the many opinions and suggestions I have received.
In this regard, it is my firm belief that fast-tracking our decentralization process will enhance the development of our Regions.
To that end, I have ordered the implementation of the necessary measures to speedily give effect to this major reform.
In the same vein, the completion of the establishment of the institutions provided for in the Constitution will contribute towards consolidating the rule of law and open a new page in our democratic process.
The year 2018 will be an important election year. All necessary measures will be taken to ensure that elections are held in peace and security.
My Dear Compatriots,
As you can see, our Nation is facing multiple challenges which we should address together in fraternity, with due respect for our institutions and in a spirit of national concord.
In this light, Cameroon is a precious legacy for each and every one of us.
Let us remain worthy of our legacy, of a united Cameroon, standing tall, proud and jealous of its freedom.
Happy New Year to you all!
Long live Cameroon!

It gives my wife and I great pleasure to welcome you, in the name of the Cameroonian people, to this Palace which is a symbol of our national unity.
Through you, I am pleased to avail myself of this opportunity to extend my country’s gratitude to the Commonwealth for its contributions in various areas since it joined the institution.
Since it became member of the Commonwealth in 1995, Cameroon, a bilingual and multicultural State, has drawn on the rich experience of its many partners to consolidate its democracy in various ways, notably protection of human rights and holding of free and fair elections. I can safely say that this example has yielded positive results which you can see for yourself.
Madam Secretary-General,
Cameroon has for long boasted of being a haven of peace and stability in our sub-region.
Unfortunately, in recent years, the terrorist organization, Boko Haram, has launched a series of deadly attacks in the Far-North of our country, which we initially confronted with our defence and national security forces, and then, with the Mixed Multinational Force formed under the aegis of the African Union.
Thanks to these valiant troops and the support of our international partners, this obscurantist and barbaric enemy has been repelled and driven into a corner. It is now reduced to launching cowardly suicide attacks, which requires us to remain alert.
Just when we thought we were through with this threat, some agitation arose about a year ago in two of our regions, the North-West and the South-West.
It started among lawyers and teachers who voiced some professional grievances. The Government considered them and ordered measures to address them. Concurrently, it set up a “Commission for the Promotion of Bilingualism and Multiculturalism” to propose solutions to maintain peace, consolidate our national unity and strengthen our resolve to live together from day to day. This Commission hit the ground running.
It is at this point that extremists chose to launch isolated attacks and assassinate law enforcement officers, in the name of a terrorist organization with purely secessionist motives.
As Guarantor of institutions under our Constitution, and in particular of national unity, it is my duty to restore order and punish those guilty of these murders.
Nonetheless, I am determined to give every chance to the aforementioned Commission. I have always thought that bilingualism and multiculturalism form our country’s special strengths, through which we are able to access two great cultures, and dialogue with multiple countries in their languages, especially in Africa.
I am convinced that the vast majority of Cameroonians share this view. That is why I will not relent in seeking solutions that can strengthen our national unity.
Madam Secretary-General,
For the rest, Cameroon must confront the problems of every developing country.
The aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis has somewhat slowed down our growth. The decline in oil and commodity prices has affected our tax revenue, leading us to conclude with the IMF a programme under the “Extended Credit Facility” whereby we should be able to return to strong growth, and avert austerity measures. We remain determined to achieve emergence by 2035.
In this regard, I consider that my country’s membership of the Commonwealth represents a double advantage of:
- participating in the cooperation programmes implemented by our common Organization, and
- establishing preferential ties with most of its members.
On both counts, I am sure there are many opportunities to be seized. To my mind, the conversations we had this morning seem very promising in this regard.
Ladies and Gentlemen, 
Distinguished Guests,
I now invite you to raise your glasses:
- to the health of Madam Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, the Right Honourable Patricia SCOTLAND, and
- to long-lasting cooperation between the Commonwealth and Cameroon. ",https://prc.cm/en/news/speeches-of-the-president/2443-president-paul-biya-advocates-for-peace-at-un-rostrum

(New York, 13 September - 24 December 2017)
General Debate
Theme:Focusing on People: Striving for
Peace and a Decent Life for All on a Sustainable Planet.
 **********
 STATEMENT BY H.E. PAUL BIYA,
PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CAMEROON
 
Mr. President,
Heads of State and Government,
The Secretary-General of the United Nations Organization,
Heads of Delegation,
I congratulate you, Mr President, on your election as chair of this session of the United Nations General Assembly. I do believe you be served by your rich experience in successfully steering our proceedings. You can count on the full cooperation of my delegation.
My congratulations also go to Ambassador Peter THOMSON, your predecessor and key mastermind behind the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda, on his outstanding achievements.
Lastly, I would like to congratulate Mr. Antonio GUTERRES on his unanimous election as Secretary-General of our Organization.
Mr. Secretary-General, please rest assured of Cameroon’s constant support in the performance of your lofty and delicate duties.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
This session is being held within a global context marked by multiple hotbeds of tension worldwide, where terrorism continues to affect thousands of people, human activity is causing climate disruptions, and poverty is far from declining. However, it is also taking place in parallel with laudable efforts towards implementing the Sustainable Development Agenda designed for Humanity’s fulfilment to ensure that no one is left behind.
Hence the full pertinence of the general debate under the theme, (I quote) “Focusing on People: Striving for Peace and a Decent Life for All on a Sustainable Planet”.
Our debates and, especially, our conclusions will constitute a litmus test of our commitment to the ideal of the peoples of the United Nations who, in the preamble to the Charter, state their resolve to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, and to promote social progress and better standards of life for all peoples.
Mr. President,
For Cameroon and most of our States, peace is the sine qua non for the survival of humanity and for sustainable development. Such peace remains dangerously under threat, notably from terrorism, conflicts, poverty and climate disruptions. Today, I would say, we are all ""beggars for peace"". And such persistent threats are of utmost concern to us all.
Mr. President,
Today, no continent, no country is spared by the scourge of terrorism, the atrocities of which unfortunately have become part and parcel of daily life. Let me mention a few examples:
-          August 2017, attacks in Barcelona and Ouagadougou;
-          July 2016, bombing of Baghdad: 292 dead;
-          October 2015, crash of a Russian Airbus in the Sinai: 224 dead;
-          March 2015, attack of mosques in Sana’a: 142 dead;
-          November 2015, attacks in Paris and Saint Denis: 130 dead, ...
When one thinks of Maiduguri, Kolofata, Fotokol ..., nothing but nameless, faceless bodies come to mind... The number of victims of the Boko-Haram terrorist sect in the Lake Chad basin is estimated at 2000. Cameroon and other neighbouring countries are grappling with the sect, which constantly changes its methods and tactics. We appreciate the support of our partners in this fight against barbarism.
The fight against this jihadist sect Boko-Haram requires more widespread mobilization if we really mean to stamp out this threat. It is killing our peoples, our communities, our independence and our democracy. Peace is at stake. In this regard, we look forward to the arrival in the Lake Chad region of the high-level mission mandated by the Security Council to the UN Secretary-General under resolution 2349.
Mr. President,
We condemn continuing conflicts in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East, which are causing pain and hardship ... so many dead ... so many refugees and displaced persons ... so many children roaming without a roof over their heads and with an uncertain or even shattered future...
Cameroon, which has hosted and continues to host thousands of refugees from the Central African Republic and Nigeria, understands how much they feel hurt, victimized and threatened in their very existence.
Therefore, let us mobilize and, through our policies, behaviours and actions, re-focus on people.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Peace is under threat not only from terrorism and other conflicts, but also from persisting poverty. The Security Council has most appropriately reiterated that poverty is a serious threat. How then can one understand that we have difficulty tackling it accordingly?
The numerous declarations and resolutions, the various United Nations development decades, as well as the plans of action and other agendas adopted by the United Nations are not fully effective. The result is clear: poverty persists and the gap between rich and poor countries is ever widening. This situation is exacerbated by the fall in commodity prices.
Mr. President, let us all mobilize in a strong surge of solidarity to roll back poverty. Let us match our actions with our words. In so doing, we will offer conditions for a decent life to our people..., thus focusing on People!
Mr. President,
We must, for present and future generations, save our planet. We therefore welcome the Paris Climate Agreement, which Cameroon, I recall, was among the first countries to sign and ratify. We are pleased that steps are being taken to implement it effectively.
I would like to take this opportunity to strongly reiterate the legitimate and unanimous wish of developing countries. As we all know, these countries pollute less, and should thus receive from rich countries, which pollute more, multifaceted means to effectively promote the goals of the Paris Agreement at their level.
For Africa, there are two major challenges.
Firstly, ongoing forest degradation in Central Africa. Let us save the Congo Basin, the earth’s second lung.
Secondly, the desertification of Lake Chad, which is drying up. This vast body of water, which is essential for the survival of communities and biodiversity, has already lost 90% of its initial surface. Let us save Lake Chad!
By so doing, we will be contributing towards preserving the planet for the greater good of humanity.
Mr. President,
The quest for peace concerns us all. All countries must pool forces to achieve peace.
Therefore, is it not yet time for the voice of poor countries, especially those of Africa, to be heard?
Is it not time, or rather high time, Africa’s message to the World were better taken into account?
Is it not high time to restructure our Organization to give more weight to Africa’s voice within a revitalized General Assembly, a Security Council that is more receptive and equitable to us?
A world characterized by greater solidarity is the sine qua non for peace on earth.
Mr. President,
Let me now conclude. Peace is our most precious asset. Without peace, we cannot take any sustainable and effective initiative in the interest of our youth and our peoples.
The theme of the debate aptly reminds us of the commitment of the founding fathers of the United Nations, namely to:
-          save succeeding generations from the scourge of war; and
-          guarantee a decent life for all free from want, through cooperation.
This debate urges us to renew our faith in the ideals and purposes of the United Nations.
Let us together take up the great challenge of world peace and development.
Once again Cameroon, as it did from this very rostrum on 10 September 2000, urges the world to rally together in a great coalition for humanity, placed back at the centre of our policies. For its sake, let us secure peace and a decent life on a sustainable planet.

We are gathered here to celebrate your brilliant exploits at athletics tracks, stadiums, tatamis and rings.
You were seen at the African Championships; you were seen at the World Championships and at the Islamic Games.
Just a few days ago, you were at the 8th Francophonie Games on the banks of River Ebrié in Côte d’Ivoire.
What a bountiful harvest you bring home: 192 medals won:
-          88 bronze, 64 silver and 60 gold.
Accordingly, thanks to you, the national anthem of the Cradle of our Fathers sounded 60 times in Africa and worldwide.
Cameroon as a whole hails your exploits.
With 192 medals won, you have just set a national record, unparalleled over the past ten years.
Your fighting spirit, your commitment, your clearly heroic endurance and your patriotism were exemplary.
What a beautiful model you have indeed been to all the youths of your country, Cameroon!
Your victories are, first and foremost, victories over yourselves.
Indeed, I can imagine all the sacrifices you had to make to prepare physically and mentally; I can imagine all the hardships and all the restrictions you readily imposed on yourselves. Such sacrifices and this ceremony are testimony thereto. Such sacrifices, I say, were not in vain. On this beautiful day, they fill you with ineffable and unforgettable joy, as they fill the hearts of the entire Cameroonian people with legitimate pride.
Your victories are, of course, also victories over your opponents, sports victories whose ultimate trophy is nothing other than the building of greater fraternity between men and peoples.
Indeed, you are the builders of the Virtual Temple of a more fraternal world, one which Mankind so badly needs at the dawn of a new millennium.
Indeed, our world is in great need of Fraternity. Even our beautiful country, Cameroon, hungers for Fraternity.
I therefore urge you, Dear Sports Friends, to lend me your robust support, your strong support, to consolidate Fraternity among us Cameroonians and, beyond, between Cameroon and the world. As such, Dear Athletes, Dear Sports people, you are our ambassadors worldwide.
We are proud of you. The cities and villages of Cameroon are still vibrating to the rhythm of your exploits. Keep it up.
Other sporting adventures lie ahead, other sporting conquests await you. AFCON 2019 is around the corner; you have a date with Africa’s sports community right here in Cameroon. And Cameroon will be ready on the D-day. You have my word.
Dear sports people, dear athletes, you are the living symbol of the Cameroon that we love, the Cameroon that we yearn for, that is, a winning Cameroon.
Before I end, I would like to thank and encourage the officials and technical staff without whom we would not have had the results we are celebrating today.
While renewing our heartfelt congratulations to you, I wish to say once again as I conclude, that Cameroon as a whole is proud of its sports movement. Cameroon is proud of you. Cameroon loves you.
Long live Cameroon’s sports movement,
Long live Cameroon.",https://prc.cm/en/news/speeches-of-the-president/2230-speech-by-h-e-paul-biya-commander-in-chief-of-the-armed-forces-at-the-graduation-ceremony-of-the-35th-batch-christened-peace-and-emergence-of-the-combined-services-academy-emia

The President of the National Assembly,
The Prime Minister, Head of Government,
The First President and the Procureur General of the Supreme Court,
Ministers,
Members of the Diplomatic Corps, 
Generals, 
Officers, Petty Officers, Non-Commissioned Officers and Soldiers,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
For several years now, our country has been grappling with various threats at its borders: maritime piracy, incursions of armed groups from neighbouring countries, hostage-taking with ransom demands and, above all, the atrocities of the Boko Haram terrorist group.
As everyone knows, Cameroon is a peaceful and hospitable country. Hence, it   would have preferred a more serene environment which is more conducive to the harmonious development to which it aspires.
It must be admitted that such is not the case in the sub-region.
As a proud, united, mutually supportive, and courageous people, Cameroonians have always found and will always find the wherewithal to face every threat and meet every challenge.
In this regard, our defence and security forces are an example which I would like to commend on this solemn occasion. They are admirably performing their duty of defending the fatherland. Thanks to their devotedness, bravery and sense of sacrifice, maritime piracy has been significantly curbed. Hostage takers are relentlessly tracked down. Boko Haram has suffered severe routs and is now reduced to merely launching sporadic assaults on civilian populations or attempting cowardly attacks.
In this fierce war against our country’s enemies, many of our sons and daughters have fallen in the field of honour; others have been wounded. I would like here to pay them glowing tribute on behalf of the entire Nation.
Also, I would like to say loud and clear that their sacrifice was not in vain. Indeed, not an inch of our territory has fallen into the hands of the enemy. Our brave and hardworking people have continued to ply their trade. As a haven of peace and stability, Cameroon has witnessed an influx of thousands of refugees from every conflict area in the region, fleeing for their lives and in quest of a sanctuary.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Nonetheless, our army would not have been so efficient without the backing and support of a united and close-nit Cameroonian people, for, while the Army is the shield of the Nation, the Nation is the granite bedrock on which the Army rests. Hailing from all the regions of Cameroon, our soldiers also have always enjoyed the unanimous support of our people, from   the South, North, East or West.
Therefore, I would like to extend my very sincere congratulations to the Cameroonian people on their commitment in the struggle to defend the fatherland, particularly through vigilante groups and on their unflinching support to our army. I urge them to remain united, supportive and strong so that together, we may be able to face all challenges, as the struggle goes on and will continue unrelentingly until the final eradication of the threats looming over our beloved and beautiful country.
I also wish to extend my profound gratitude to Cameroon’s friendly countries for their valuable support in our fight against terrorism.
Young Officers of the “Peace and Emergence” batch,
It is against this backdrop that you are today joining the big family of Defence Forces.
You have chosen the military profession. This profession, one of the most beautiful in the world, is noble, demanding and exalting. It is also the only one where the ultimate sacrifice is accepted as an eventuality.
The career you have just entered requires strict discipline, unwavering loyalty to the institutions of the republic and constant availability. I urge you to carry on the duty of defending and protecting the fatherland, just like your elders who have distinguished themselves on battlefields.
Your batch name is particularly revealing in the current context. For our country, it shows the need for peace in our march towards emergence. Indeed, no nation can aspire to economic development unless it enjoys lasting peace.
Throughout your career, the baptismal name of your batch should serve as your guide and help you to always bear in mind the need to preserve peace for our country’s development.
Young Officers of the “Peace and Emergence” batch,
On this memorable day, I am pleased, on behalf of the entire Nation, to extend to you my heartfelt congratulations.
I extend my sincere appreciation to your civilian and military instructors for their seriousness and competence during your training.
I also salute your mates from brotherly and friendly countries for their success. Their presence among you is not only proof that their countries recognize the quality of the Combined Services Academy, but also bears testimony to our excellent relations with them.
Young Officers,
This ceremony is a moment of legitimate joy and pride.
However, I must remind you that our country is at war. A war being waged against us by an obscurantist and barbaric enemy.
Henceforth, you will be expected to be part of a great and noble struggle, that of defending the territorial integrity, national unity and institutions of the republic. Such is the sacred duty and prime task of our armed forces.
That is your mission.
The mission is clear.
You should accomplish it with honour and loyalty.
You should accomplish it with the full force of your patriotic commitment.
You should draw inspiration from the self-denial and sense of sacrifice of your elders.
You can count on my constant solicitude and the full support of the Cameroonian people.
Long live Cameroon’s Defence Forces!
Long live Cameroon!

My wife and I wish you a warm welcome to Unity Palace. 
I would like to express to you my sincere congratulations as well as those of the entire Cameroonian People on your brilliant performance during the just ended Women Africa Cup of Nations. 
Although you did not win the final game, you won our hearts and aroused our admiration.
You scored beautiful and major victories in style against experienced teams. Through your talent, courage, commitment and zeal to defend the colours of your country, you thrilled the entire Nation.   
You never gave up. You fought to the end, for your flag and your country.
Cameroon is thanking you. Cameroon is saying Bravo! You are Lionesses. You are true Indomitable Lionesses. 
Ladies and Gentlemen, 
With the just ended Women Africa Cup of Nations, Cameroon has scored another beautiful victory, that of organization. The feast was indeed beautiful and colourful. Our guests had the opportunity to appreciate our country’s wealth and cultural diversity, the quality of our sports infrastructure and the hospitality of our people. 
In this regard, I wish to congratulate all those who worked for the success of the Women AFCON. The challenge was enormous, but we faced it in great style; we have every reason to be proud of what we have achieved. The quality of organization of this event and the popular fervour it raised augur well for the Africa Football Cup of Nations that Cameroon will host in 2019.
I can assure you that we will, together, equally rise up to that challenge. 
Dear Indomitable Lionesses, 
Today, you are a source of inspiration and an example to be emulated by millions of Cameroonians and, particularly, our youths. 
Your strength, of course, lies in your exceptional talent. It also and, above all, lies in your hard work, your courage, your solidarity, your team spirit, your unity and your love for your country. I encourage you to keep on and you will continue to win. 
I can assure you that public authorities will not relent in their efforts to provide the infrastructure and resources needed to develop your talents.  
I wish to thank and congratulate your management, particularly the Head Coach Enow Ngatchou and his team, as well as our football authorities who did a remarkable job.
Dear Indomitable Lionesses, 
As you prepare to return to your respective clubs, I once more extend to you the gratitude and congratulations of the entire Nation. Wherever you are, continue to fly the flag of your country high. Cameroon is proud of you. Be proud to be Cameroonians! 
Thank you.­",https://prc.cm/en/news/speeches-of-the-president/2033-toast-by-the-head-of-state-at-the-diner-offered-by-the-presidential-couple-in-honour-of-his-excellency-macky-sall-president-of-the-republic-of-senegal

We are deeply moved by the message of friendship and solidarity you bring from the people of Senegal.
I wish you and your delegation a warm welcome and a pleasant stay with us.
Mr. President,
Cameroon and Senegal have long-standing relations founded on fruitful and dynamic cooperation.
We share the same values, including attachment to democracy, peace, dialogue and African unity.
We are both concerned with creating a more conducive environment for the prosperity and well-being of our peoples, and this is reflected in our common resolve to fight terrorism and under-development. 
Mr. President, 
Your visit to Cameroon today is a token of friendship that we deeply appreciate. It also bears testimony to our common determination to continue working together for greater cooperation between our two countries and closer friendship between our two peoples.

My wife and I are happy to once again welcome you to this Palace, symbol of the Cameroonian nation.
Immediately you received news of the train disaster in my country, you extended to us the condolences of the Chadian people. In your capacity as current Chairperson of the African Union, you also extended the condolences of the peoples of Africa.
This tragedy, this disaster, this trial has shocked the people of Cameroon as a whole. So many of our compatriots have lost their lives… So many others have been injured…
In addition to your message of condolence, you have come today in person to bring us the comfort of your friendship. Thank you, Mr President and dear Brother.
It is said that it is in adversity that one recognizes his true friends …
That is why we are profoundly moved by your gesture. Moreover, it is no surprise to us, as we are aware of the depth, density and solidity of the ties binding us. These ties are founded on relations established in the course of History between two neighbouring peoples who have a lot in common.
More recently, thanks to these relations, we were able to stand TOGETHER and push back our common enemy when the security, and even the very existence, of our countries were threatened.
Today, the sympathy and compassion you have come to extend to us are heart-warming.
Beyond that, I am certain they strengthen our common determination to further develop our relations in all areas.
Although this is not the moment to discuss cooperation plans, I am convinced, Mr President and dear Brother, that the natural solidarity that exists between Chad and Cameroon will be   strengthened by the trials we will have to face.
It is true condolences do not bring the dead back to life. They, however, nurture, consolidate and enhance trust among those who are still living.
Dear Brother, 
Once again, thank you from the bottom of my heart for coming.
I now invite you to raise your glasses to friendship and solidarity between Chad and Cameroon.

My thoughts and immediate words of comfort go out first of all to the families of those killed and to the injured. I wish to once again extend to them my heartfelt condolences. I wish a speedy recovery to those injured.
Faced with such an unprecedented disaster in our country, I have instructed the Government to take a number of actions and measures. In particular, I have prescribed an in-depth inquiry into the root causes of this incident or tragedy. I have also instructed that those injured should be treated in the various hospitals at the expense of the State. I have decided that October 24 should be declared a national day of mourning.
I believe that this is the best way to express solidarity between the entire nation and the victims of this disaster.
I must also underscore that the Government’s response was fairly positive, be it with regard to the engineers who did their best to re-establish traffic between Yaounde and Douala and all the other government services, including the Ministry of Transport and the Ministry of Public Works, which transported the victims and combed through the area to determine the extent of the disaster. 
I believe that this national day of mourning should be placed under the banner of patriotic fervour, under the sign of the union of hearts so that together we can continue to meet future challenges. At any rate, I urge Cameroonians to be courageous, dynamic and determined in such circumstances”.

Cameroon congratulates you on your election as President of this session. Your rich experience in the public and private sector both nationally and internationally,   as well as your human qualities, augur well for our proceedings. In this regard, I wish to assure you of my country’s support and the full collaboration of its delegation.
I am also pleased to commend the work done by your predecessor, Mr Mogens Lykketoft, whose tenure was marked by successful initiatives to make the United Nations a more open and transparent Organization.
Lastly, I would like to pay a glowing tribute to Mr Ban Ki-moon for the achievements made during his two terms within a particularly challenging difficult global context. 
Cameroon, for its part, feels honoured about his visit in 2010 and hails the strengthening, during his term, of the excellent cooperation ties it enjoys with the United Nations Organization. 
Mr Secretary-General, you will always be welcome to our country.
Mr President,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
This session is opening in a context marked by turmoil of various kinds, where thankfully, there are some bright spots and glimmers of hope.
In a remarkable show of human solidarity, we have, in recent years, laid the building blocks of one destiny for humankind. Let me mention in particular the Rio+20 outcome document which is meaningfully titled “The Future We Want”, as well as the 17 Sustainable Development Goals of the new 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and lastly, the Paris Agreement obtained at COP21. 
Within this context, my country welcomes your decision to place your tenure under the banner of implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It therefore hails the holding of this debate on the Sustainable Development Goals nine months after their adoption. The SDGs, it should be recalled, constitute the first global agenda that considers development in all its dimensions: security, economic, social, human and environmental.
Clearly, the originality of the 2030 Agenda lies in the fact that it goes beyond the conventional indicators of economic growth. It truly focuses on human progress, humanity’s heritage, commonweal, security for all ... It is an ambitious agenda which requires everyone’s genuine involvement.
Under this agenda, our common goal is to alleviate poverty and to leave no one behind. It is a challenge that we have set for ourselves and that we must take up together in order to respond to the expectations of our peoples and in short, the summons of history.
Mr President, as you are aware, we have, in the past, adopted agendas, declarations, and action programmes which raised great hopes in the world among the youth, women and men in the cities and in the countryside. They heralded a new world of peace and shared prosperity.
Nonetheless, the agreed actions have only been partially implemented. We deplored this whenever we had to, right here: we failed to honour all our commitments, especially financial. We did not fulfil all the hopes and aspirations of our peoples.
Today, let us get organized to ensure that the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) fare better. Since it is about ""transforming our world and leaving no one behind"", let us then find wherewithal to realize our ambitions. 
Such wherewithal, in our opinion, is of three categories:
-Firstly, political: our political will should be constant and not wax and wane according to circumstances.
-Secondly, financial: our contributions should be predictable, certain and adequate. This will require unprecedented mobilization.
-Lastly, moral: the principle of the duty of solidarity among peoples should be reaffirmed and observed.
In so doing, we will be helping the SDGs accelerate the advent of a world of peace for all everywhere, a world of prosperity for all.
As you are aware, Mr President, it is no longer a matter of promises. It is time for commitment. It is time for action. 
Our efforts will encounter various obstacles, including persistent conflicts and rising terrorism. My country is in a position to talk about them, having been engaged over the past three years in a veritable war against the latter scourge. This new type of threat to peace and development, I readily repeat, requires a collective response, collective determination and action.
Goal 16 of the Agenda for Sustainable Development, which focuses on the promotion and advent of peaceful and inclusive societies should, as far as we are concerned, help us to efficiently fight Boko Haram. As underscored by one of the targets of this goal,  we should, quote “strengthen relevant national institutions, including through international cooperation, for building capacity at all levels, in particular in developing countries, to prevent violence and combat terrorism and crime”, unquote.
Mr President,
Cameroon wishes to thank you for inviting her, alongside the other UN member countries, to this debate on the implementation of SDGs, this new universal push to transform the world. 
The outcomes of previous agendas and programmes have shown us the urgent need to find wherewithal to achieve our ambitions. 
If we decide, here and now, to effectively and concretely mobilize our immense resources, 
If we decide to devote them to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, 
Then will the SDGs truly become this push to transform today’s world into a world of peace and shared prosperity.
Thank you Mr President.

The President of the United States of America,
Distinguished Heads of State and Government,
The Secretary-General of the United Nations,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Permit me, first and foremost, to add my voice to those of previous speakers to thank President Barack Obama and Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, for their welcome initiative to convene this summit.
The refugee issue, as we all know, is one of the major challenges of our century. I will spare you the statistics which have already been mentioned here, and which show that the problem is serious. Given the magnitude of this human tragedy which pricks our collective conscience, we have a historic responsibility, namely to take action. My   country will not shirk that responsibility.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
True to its tradition of hospitality and solidarity, and by virtue of its stability, Cameroon is a haven for people seeking peace and safe refuge.
To date, my country hosts more than 350 000 refugees of different nationalities. To cope with this influx, my Government has taken measures to provide decent living conditions for them. In recent years, refugee camps have been set up in collaboration with the UNHCR to settle Nigerian refugees fleeing the atrocities of the Boko Haram sect, and those from the Central African Republic faced with political instability. Minawao Camp alone, for instance, hosts over 80 000 Nigerian refugees.
At these reception sites, the refugees enjoy basic social services provided by the Cameroon Government, friendly countries, the UNHCR and humanitarian organizations. Facilities are offered, particularly in education, at all levels.
Healthwise, the Cameroon Government recently signed a framework agreement with the UNHCR to jointly provide care to refugees in our local hospitals.
Regarding protection, measures have been taken to issue secured identity cards to persons eligible for refugee status.
Despite the huge financial impact of implementing these measures, we will continue with and increase our assistance to refugees and hundreds of thousands of displaced persons in Cameroon’s Far-North Region, who are also fleeing the atrocities of the Boko Haram terrorist organization. 
At this juncture, I would like to appeal for increased international community support to countries, which like Cameroon, are hosting hundreds of thousands of refugees on their territories.
Also, let me draw the attention of the distinguished personalities here present to the situation of some areas of my country which are ravaged by terrorism, and where reconstruction will require substantial resources. Such is the price to pay for the resettlement of the affected people.
I would like to conclude with acknowledgements.
My very sincere thanks go to all friendly countries for their constant support to our fight against terrorism.
We thank them as well as International organizations and civil society. We particularly appreciate their support for our determination to provide to persons in distress, dignified reception and living conditions, and to their children, access to education.  
Thank you.",https://prc.cm/en/news/speeches-of-the-president/1779-international-economic-conference-of-yaounde-opening-speech-by-h-e-paul-biya-president-of-the-republic-of-cameroon

Ladies and Gentlemen,
First of all, I would like to express my profound gratitude to all the personalities from the world of politics, business and finance gathered here today. I wish to thank you for accepting our invitation.
Cameroon highly appreciates your presence at this conference. To us, this clearly marks your interest in the modernization of our economy and improvement of the living conditions of our people.
Permit me now to recall the objective, or rather, objectives of today’s conference.
Its purpose is firstly, to review the key components of Cameroon’s economy; to determine the private sector’s potential contribution to its expansion; and thereafter, assess the country’s real opportunities that would ensure its integration into the global economy, in a more judicious and helpful manner.
The findings of this review will be highly instrumental in implementing our economic policy. They could, perhaps, be useful to other African countries facing a situation similar to ours.
Secondly, and this will certainly mark the highpoint of our conference, we will facilitate meetings between public and private project initiators alike, and foreign as well as local investors. To borrow from economic lingo, this conference affords an excellent opportunity to create a veritable “investment market” right here. 
It is not my place here to give you an overview of Cameroon’s economy. Certainly, that will be done during the roundtable devoted to the macro-economic situation and growth prospects.
For my part, I would rather highlight some salient facts of a general nature in a way that would reveal our innermost views as well as our genuine aspirations for lasting prosperity in the current geostrategic context.
I will start off with a few words about our continent:
The continent that in the sixties was considered “doomed” has become, according to some observers, a “continent of the future”...
Of course, I am sincerely delighted, but at the same time, I must admit that I remain rather cautious about the overly optimistic and unqualified forecasts made by some people.
They highlight the growth rates ranging across countries from 5% to 10% over the years.
However, we must recall that growth is not an end in itself. Moreover, it has been acknowledged, even by the most prominent international economic institutions, that we must go beyond the quantitative measurement of growth rate, to seek a tangible improvement in people’s living conditions.
What matters here is, first of all, our ability to actually put people at the centre of our economic endeavours.
Serving the human person and his overall well-being should constitute the be-all and end-all of our investment choices, and our priorities for wealth creation.
Similarly, it is only through sustainable management of global resources that we can ensure true prosperity.
This is a global obligation, but it particularly concerns Africa, considering that it has to catch up and also the numerous inequities of the global context often affecting the continent, which lacks the real wherewithal to defend itself.
Obviously, its marginal position spared it from the full impact of the shocks of the financial crisis of 2007 and 2008. Nonetheless, the continent has suffered its delayed effects such as the collapse of oil and other commodity prices, the slowdown in investment, etc.
Admittedly, Africa is gradually entering globalization. One could even envisage that the continent’s role would be increasingly prominent in the global economy as the years go by.
Its high population growth and expanding middle class create conditions conducive to   market attractiveness in terms of mass consumption and infrastructure development.
The youthfulness and dynamism of its population are reasons for optimism. The African youth, in particular, are a major asset for the continent. They should be at the forefront of technology to ensure that Africa   hooks up to an economy where innovation is, now more than ever before, a decisive factor of competitiveness.
To this should be added the abundant and diverse natural resources, which progressively should be processed locally in order to be more beneficial to our economies.
Undoubtedly, all these features will make Africa a partner that is constantly coveted by the most advanced countries in their quest for resources to reboot their economies.
In a world marked by ever-growing economic and social interdependence, the challenge is to develop genuine areas of shared prosperity. This involves forging new types of economic and socio-political relations based on the idea of mutual benefit between partners.
In this type of relationship, some contribute their financing capability and their technology, while others offer unique opportunities to be seized, and rare resources to be tapped, all in a fair and equitable exchange. 
Such is the new type of relationship that we should seek in economic partnership agreements with the European Union, for instance, and also with any other partners…
The private sector should play a key role in such a set up. Africa, where the State often occupies a prominent position in the economy, will need to foster business development. 
Such is what Cameroon is seeking. It will pursue efforts in that direction to lend the best possible support to domestic and foreign investments. 
Here too, it is important to promote the establishment of true win-win partnerships between local businesses and major international firms.
Distinguished Guests,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
As you are aware, Cameroon’s objective is to become an emerging country by 2035. This ambition, I believe, is largely shared by our people who have transformed it into a national cause. All our public policies and, particularly our public finance management are geared towards achieving this objective. 
Our expansionary budget is based on a fiscal policy which prioritizes expenditure quality. Our public debt, contained at around 25 % of GDP, is closely monitored. It must remain constantly at a sustainable level, while providing us with productive financing resources.
We are optimistic that the consolidation of these conditions will endear us even more to investors.
Moreover, I am fond of saying that Cameroon, Africa in miniature, is not coming empty-handed to this give-and-take forum. Indeed, it has abundant assets, hence its attractiveness: 
The most populated country in the CEMAC zone sharing a more than 1 500 km-long border with Nigeria, Africa’s leading economy, Cameroon stands out thanks to its strategic position at the crossroads between West and Central Africa and at the intersection between the ECOWAS and CEMAC zones.
 Its Atlantic coastline, its rail network, its three international airports and 50 000 km of road all of which are constantly developing foster its integration into regional and global trade.
 It abounds with natural resources and its varied soils, climates and natural environments are suitable for agriculture.
 With Africa’s second hydro-electric potential and huge natural gas reserves, Cameroon has embarked on varied and large-scale energy infrastructure construction. The phased commissioning of such infrastructure is opening up bright prospects for the availability of sustainable, adequate and permanent energy.
 Additionally, the country is endowed with an expanding and diversified industrial fabric with many small and medium size enterprises and industries (SMEs/SMIs) ready to enter into subcontracting and co-contracting agreements.
 There is abundant, young and qualified labour force for a country with one of the highest school enrolment rates in sub-Saharan Africa.
 Above all, Cameroon is determined to encourage private investment. An appropriate legal framework has been put in place to that end. 
Based on the law on investment incentives, the framework will enable the development of priority high-impact sectors which are:
- agribusiness;
- transport infrastructure;
- energy;
- low-cost housing and urban development;
- the extractive industry; and
new technologies.
All these measures bear sufficient testimony to Cameroon’s strong determination to attract more and more productive investments on its soil so as to accelerate economic growth and prosperity for its people.
Cameroon is a haven of peace, respecting    the rule of law and a country of liberty. Its institutions are stable, functional and harmonious. They are capable of adapting to societal trends to ensure social peace, the security of persons and property and the country’s political stability at all times. 
In today’s world, and particularly in Africa, this, we believe, is a major asset for investors. 
Distinguished Guests,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Your presence here expresses your determination to contribute towards fulfilling our country’s legitimate aspirations. 
Cameroon will bear that in mind. 
I wish everyone fruitful discussions for mutually beneficial partnerships, and of course, I wish our numerous visitors, a pleasant stay in Cameroon. 
Thank you.

Ladies and Gentlemen,
First of all, I would like to thank and commend my brother and friend, President BUHARI, for the excellent organization of the second regional security summit and for the warm welcome accorded us throughout our stay.
Right off, I’ll say that this summit, whose importance is clear to everyone, has met expectations. It has afforded us an opportunity, on the one hand, to take stock of the decisions adopted in Paris in 2014, and on the other hand, lay the groundwork for a number of actions to be undertaken in the coming years.
On the first point, we’ve noted that the said decisions have yielded positive results. Cooperation among countries of the frontline zone has helped to check Boko Haram attacks and neutralize its offensive capability. The terrorist organization is now reduced to suicide attacks, which are somewhat the weapon of the weak and cowardly.
The fight against Boko Haram has been effective thanks also to support from our key international partners, notably the United States, France, the United Kingdom, Germany, China, Russia and the European Union. Of course, the African Union’s contribution through the Joint Multinational Task Force has been decisive. I must also mention the assistance provided to refugees and displaced persons by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and by humanitarian organizations such as “Médecins Sans Frontières”.
Regarding the future, we intend to maintain and strengthen the tried and tested military cooperation among countries of the Lake Chad Basin Commission (LCBC). We’ve also agreed to focus attention on some specific issues, namely the situation of refugees and displaced persons, and reconstruction of facilities in areas devastated by Boko Haram.
On this point, I should recall that the resurgence of phenomena such as Boko Haram will be best prevented through improved livelihoods for the people and their increased access to education.
Lastly, the Summit reviewed the Lake Chad Region Development and Climate Change Adaptation Plan. The implementation of this major project will serve as an example.
Before concluding, I’ll add that I was very pleased that several of our colleagues from West and Central Africa have joined us. This makes me believe that security, as a common concern for our two regions, is gaining ground.
The decisions reached on all these issues are captured in the communiqués, and the decisions that will be taken.
I thank the major powers, notably those I have mentioned and the European Union for their assistance. They can rest assured that Africa is determined to fight and defeat Boko Haram

Mrs AISHA BUHARI,
Mr Vice-President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria,
Mr Speaker of the Senate,
Mr Speaker of the House of Representatives,
Mr President of the Supreme Court,
Distinguished Members of Government,
Members of the Diplomatic Corps,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I am pleased to be in your capital city Abuja, whose charm and beauty always strike a visitor. And I have personally noticed on every visit, that the city is in a state of flux. 
Also, I would like to thank you for the exceptional welcome accorded me, my wife and my delegation upon my arrival in your great country. I do appreciate it. 
I would be tempted to say it bears the hallmarks of the legendary hospitality of the Nigerian people.
Mr President, Dear Brother,
My visit follows that which you made   to Yaounde last year, a visit which definitely marked a turning point in our relations. Henceforth, there will be a pre- and a post-July 2015 in the history of Nigeria - Cameroon relations.
We have observed that we have a lot in common and that there is a wide array of cooperation opportunities between our two countries. But above all, we have noted that we have a common enemy. Of course, I am referring to Boko Haram, whose obscurantist goals and barbaric methods run counter to the aspirations of our peoples.
What our peoples really desire is development which will bring about an improvement in their living conditions and a society of peace, prosperity and fraternity. Having to face a common threat has undoubtedly been a driving force behind the rapprochement and understanding between Nigeria and Cameroon, such as the brotherly cooperation between our armies. 
In the meantime, the offensives launched by the Nigerian Army against Boko Haram positions have, as you said, “technically” neutralized the terrorist organization, while the forces of the other countries of the Lake Chad Basin Commission (including Cameroon) have been harassing the terrorist groups that have retreated to the border areas. I wish at this point to congratulate the defence and security forces of all our countries and the Multinational Joint Task Force on their vigilance and efficiency.
There is now reason to hope that very soon, Boko Haram which has been severely weakened, will no longer have its disruptive capacity.
Also, I would like to express my sympathy for the numerous victims of the suicide attacks perpetrated by the terrorist organization in Nigeria, as well as my wish to see the young Chibok girls freed soon.
Right away, I would like to hail the measures thus far taken, on your initiative, to restore public authority in the areas that have been seized back, and to ease the resettlement of displaced persons. Rest assured, Mr President and Dear Brother, that Cameroon will continue to provide all the necessary assistance to your compatriots who were compelled to flee combat zones. Incidentally, that is just another good turn for your country’s hospitality to Cameroonians who have chosen to live in Nigeria.
In due time, we should, each country on its own and collectively, draw the lessons learnt from the Boko Haram episode. 
I believe once the terrorist phenomenon is eradicated, it will be in the interest of Lake Chad area countries, notably Nigeria and Cameroon, to consult with one another to prevent its resurgence. Of course, the idea will be to come up with common military and security measures, but also other measures likely to accelerate development in the regions concerned. We are indeed aware that under-development, poverty and ignorance, are fertile ground for activities of terrorist movements such as Boko Haram.
That is why, Mr President, Dear Brother, I believe it would be worthwhile, for starters, to design joint development projects in our border areas which are sometimes neglected. Using the resources they have, agricultural and infrastructure projects could be considered jointly. To that end, we need to link our road networks (that is ongoing), provide electricity (which Cameroon will be able to do in the medium term) and provide social facilities in those areas. 
I am referring particularly to areas that have been devastated by Boko Haram and where displaced people will have to be resettled.
Pending that, I believe we should do all we can to strengthen and diversify our cooperation ties. In this regard, between us there are various agreements whose implementation would yield positive outcomes for our two countries.
The next session of our Joint Commission could afford us the opportunity of reinvigorating our cooperation ties in some areas.
Similarly, it would be necessary for the Mixed Commission tasked with demarcating our common border to complete its work, and for the framework agreement on crossborder cooperation on hydrocarbons to be finalized.  
But I am convinced that we need to aim higher and see farther. 
Overall, I believe the economic relations between our two countries are far from having reached their full potential. There will be a need for consultations in this regard between us at the level of government bodies and professional associations. Business forums could also be held in each of our countries to showcase available opportunities to investors. 
Mr President, Dear Brother,
We are at the beginning of a new era in the relations between our two countries. This to me is confirmed by our discussions of today and the signing of agreements that ensued.  I feel elated. I sincerely believe that this development does not only serve the interests of both governments, but also fulfils the wishes of the Nigerian and Cameroonian peoples. Hence, I have no doubt that this road which we will be travelling together will lead to success.
Thank you Ladies and Gentlemen and I wish that solidarity and fraternity between Cameroon and Nigeria will continue to go from strength to strength.

My wife and I are very pleased to welcome you, as well as your daughter Laura MATTARELLA and the delegation accompanying you, to Cameroon. We wish you a warm welcome and a pleasant stay among us.
We are honoured by your choice of Cameroon as one of the laps of your maiden visit to Africa. That choice bears testimony to the solid friendship ties existing between our two countries, and also reflects their excellent relationship. The talks we have held today and the discussions between our business leaders augur well for the future of our relations.
Cameroon is grateful to you for this mark of interest and offers you its legendary hospitality in this Palace, which symbolizes of the unity of our people.
Cameroon is a young nation. It is   resolutely pursuing its goal, which is to build a modern, democratic and prosperous State. 
Despite numerous challenges, we are making significant and tangible progress each day, in areas such as promotion of the rule of law, freedoms and protection of human rights.
Similarly, we are each day striving to lay a solid foundation for real economic development through ambitious projects designed to make Cameroon an emerging country by 2035.
In this regard, following an arduous structural adjustment period, Cameroon has, for some years now, returned to growth, which stood at 6% in 2015 thanks to the sacrifices made by its sons and daughters, and with the assistance of its partners, among which, Italy.
I would like to thank your country here and now for its direct and indirect support.
Mr President, 
As you are aware, terrorism is today a major global concern. Cameroon is not spared by it. For over two years now, peace has been under threat in the northern part of our country. We are engaged in a war started by BOKO HARAM, a Nigerian-based horde of terrorists claiming to belong to the Islamic State. Nationals of friendly countries, including Italians, have been victims of this war. Fathers GIANPAOLO MARTA and GIANTONIO ALLEGRINI were abducted sometime ago by these unscrupulous men. We freed them.  
We are responding strongly to the terrorist atrocities. We are tracking down these assassins and inflicting heavy and multiple losses on them daily with the backing of the Multinational Task Force and that of many friendly countries, including Italy. 
BOKO HARAM terrorists are causing a massive influx of refugees on our territory. Faced with so many distressed people, we are duty bound by human solidarity not to turn away those seeking refuge, and to welcome and share with them the little we have.
Europe and in particular Italy are, mutatis mutandis, currently experiencing a similar situation, having to grapple with an unprecedented migrant crisis. 
I have always believed that any lasting solution to this thorny issue should be based on social morality and human values which I know Italy holds dear. 
Indeed, more than ever before, our world needs greater solidarity.
On the economic front, such solidarity, as I have often said, means the need for shared global prosperity. It is not about some begging for charity and others doling it out sparingly. 
It is about progressing together under a solidarity pact, as good partners, willing at all times to conclude mutually beneficial agreements.
Mr President,
Cameroon is endowed with huge and varied natural resources. Its excellent ecological conditions and vast expanses of fertile land are conducive to agriculture. Its subsoil abounds in diverse mineral resources. 
Such huge potential requires more judicious exploitation and increased local processing. Also, there is a need for accelerated development of multiple economic and social infrastructures. 
Accordingly, I call on Italian enterprises, which are known to be competent and serious to take an interest in the various programmes. By so doing, they will be contributing, alongside us and within the framework of the solidarity pact I mentioned earlier on, towards creating in our country and providing much better living conditions for our youths. This will dissuade them from risking their lives in quest of an imaginary El Dorado.  
I am aware, Mr President, that many of your enterprises have already established partnerships in the areas of  raw materials processing and public works. I am also aware that other partnerships are being negotiated in the infrastructure development and housing sector. 
Mr President of the Italian Republic, your country has been lending invaluable support to the Chantal BIYA International Reference Centre (CBIRC) for research on HIV since its inception ten years ago. Before I conclude, I would like to thank you most sincerely for that.
Ladies and Gentlemen, 
Distinguished Guests,
My wife and I now invite you to raise your glasses in honour of the President of the Italian Republic, His Excellency Sergio MATTARELLA, his daughter Laura MATTARELLA and the delegation accompanying him, and to friendship between Italy and Cameroon.
Thank you.

The Head of State made the call on the eve of Youth Day 2016, which equally marks fifty years of a celebration dedicated to the Youth, who constitute the future of the Nation.
My dear young compatriots,
The celebration of the National Youth Day always affords me a singular opportunity to address you.
This year, we are celebrating the fiftieth edition of the Youth Day, which is proof that the entire nation has been paying constant attention to youths for half a century now.
It cannot be an overstatement to say that our youths constitute a major asset for the nation’s future. They are numerous and full of potential, dynamic and ambitious, conquering and creative.
In this regard, I wish to hail our young compatriots who have distinguished themselves lately through major innovations which are acknowledged by all. They took bold initiatives in the highly competitive domain of new information technologies and in many other domains such as agriculture.
They were not afraid. They were daring. Such has always been my recommendation to you. They were able to weather the deficiencies in our country which is still in the building process, and they have achieved the excellent results which we can all be proud of.
They are exemplars of personal patriotic commitment for our society. They deserve everyone’s support. May they serve as a source of inspiration for those who are still hesitating or dragging their feet!
My dear young compatriots, 
Patriotism is a virtue that some people might wrongly consider outdated. Even today, it remains a mark of responsible and nobly asserted citizenship for the nation.
Regardless of your role in society, you should be patriotic to deserve well of the nation: the farmer on his farm, the pupil or student in their studies, the workman on his work site, the teacher in the classroom, the doctor or nurse at the hospital, the researcher in his laboratory, the civil servant in his office, the trader in his shop, the mechanic in his garage, the sweeper at his workplace, the transporter driving his vehicle.
We should each ply our trade with patriotic love. Only then will we become forces of progress for our country.
In this regard, take the example of our youths who are engaged at the war front. For the past two years, they have been protecting our country from the terrorist threat. They are sustained and driven by patriotic love, often to the point of sacrificing their lives.
Their behaviour is unlike that of some other youths who do everything possible to get recruited into the public service and then desert their duty stations while continuing to receive their salaries. They represent examples of what should not be done.
Some youths join the public service just to obtain a service number, as they are fond of saying. These do not deserve well of the nation.
The unbridled quest for easy profit and wealth is a road to perdition that should be shunned by the youths.
It is proper for our youths to be imbued with republican and civic values. These should form the basis of a genuine commitment on every front, be it security, economic, cultural or socio-political.
My dear young compatriots,
I am fully aware of the difficulties you are facing. I know your doubts and worries. I know especially that you have difficulty getting a job.
Our capacity to create decent jobs is constrained by external factors related to the global economic environment, coupled with some domestic red tape. Nevertheless, we are not giving up. Our efforts over the past few years are starting to pay off.
The imminent commissioning of major infrastructures and the ongoing Three-Year Emergency Plan should consolidate such gains. 
In the medium term, the launching of the extensive industrialization programme which I outlined on 31 December last year should create many job opportunities.
The development of our agricultural sector will be accorded a prime place. In this regard, I urge you to truly revolutionize your mindset. The soil has never betrayed anyone. Do not be afraid to take the plunge and become the agricultural entrepreneurs that Cameroon needs. It is a noble and rewarding trade in the so-called real economy.
I therefore I urge the elders to shoulder their responsibility: it is proper to urge the youths to work the land and it is unwise to dissuade them from doing so.
It is equally important to set a good example for them: urban workers should also undertake activities in rural areas. Through their actions and those of the Government, we should make our villages more youth-friendly. 
It is not a matter of waiting to amass substantial resources. It is, first and foremost, a matter of determination and commitment. In agriculture, a little often goes a long way. 
There are many Government programmes designed to support rural development. Obtain information on    such programmes. You should be able to make the most of them. 
In addition, there is another domain which I know you of the so-called ""Android"" generation hold most dear, namely the development of the digital economy. 
To each generation, its historic challenges for the nation’s future! I can say that one of the major challenges for our youths is to manage to keep abreast of the astounding phenomenon of the digital economy. 
I urge the entire nation to resolutely mobilize and support the numerous initiatives undertaken by our youths in this area:
-  The Government should systematically and effectively continue setting up appropriate infrastructure, but also cleaning up and properly regulating this key sector in the interest of the national economy and the development of youth employment.
-  Public or private training institutions are called upon to fully play their role. They must identify the new trades and tailor their syllabuses accordingly.
-  Large enterprises and other public and private entities should set the example by progressively carrying out their own digital switchover.
-  Financial institutions definitely stand to benefit by developing specific programmes to support youth-initiated projects in this new economy. 
It is through such collective commitment that we will be able to rise to the challenge of digital transition. 
These two sectors, namely agriculture and digital economy, require us to continue with and step up the professionalization of our secondary education.
In higher education, the various stakeholders have been mobilized to progressively provide the job market with human resources that meet the new requirements.  
Enterprises are not seeking out for just graduates, but a labour force that is well trained in specific trades and that is constantly adapted to global trends.
To meet this expectation, I am pleased to note that the Government has opened three Pilot Centres of Excellence in Douala, Limbe and Sangmelima, at the cost of about 21 billion, to provide retraining and skills upgrading for senior technicians and other skilled workers.
The economic integration of youths is thus a constant concern. Our actions will continue with greater momentum to enable our youths to make the most of the numerous programmes and projects that are underway or in the pipeline. 
To that end, I have just given instructions for the launch of a three-year ""Special Youth"" plan worth CFAF 102 billion in total.
This plan should facilitate and accelerate the economic integration of our youths. We should all take a keen interest in it. In so doing, I believe, you will be demonstrating your “economic patriotism”.
Furthermore, I believe that you could reap much benefit from the good citizenship education programmes offered by the Civic Service Agency for Participation in Development. 
This very timely initiative has already set up hundreds of local committees countrywide. You should sign on and enjoy its benefits.
My dear young compatriots,
I gave you a hint about it. The sky is gradually clearing up. The clouds are dispersing progressively. 
I am aware that you, more than the other population segments, are affected by unemployment. I, however, urge you to look to the future with more confidence. Of course, we have not yet reached our goal, but we are making progress against all the odds.
More effort is definitely required from us to achieve stronger, more stable and more sustainable growth. We will undoubtedly continue to encounter obstacles along the way; however, it behoves us to overcome them resolutely and bravely with everyone’s participation.
I have just outlined all the benefits you can reap from working the land, from our new-found industrialization and also from the digital economy.
Thus, through your active participation, you are expected to inevitably and progressively take the nation’s future into your own hands, under the benevolent mentorship of the elders, in a properly organized blending of generations. 
To that end, you should have faith in the future, despite the challenges.
Rest assured that I will spare no effort to support you in your determination to succeed. 
Happy Youth Day to each and every one of you!
Long live Cameroon’s youths!
Long live Cameroon!

I would like, first and foremost, to wish you a very warm and cordial welcome to Cameroon.
I would also like to say that my wife and I are pleased to be your hosts in this Palace, the symbol of our country’s unity.
Your visit bears testimony to the excellent relationship between the International Monetary Fund and Cameroon, a relationship spanning over half a century.
We do appreciate the guidance, assistance and cooperation provided us by your institution, which has always stood by Cameroon, especially at its most challenging economic and financial times.
We live in an ever-changing world.
Instability, volatility and deregulation are rife; no economy is completely spared.
The much-expected economic and social progress of peoples is quite often jeopardized. And for the weakest economies, such external shocks are difficult to overcome.
Over the last five years, despite a difficult global context, Cameroon has been able to maintain a relatively significant level of growth. This has been achieved thanks to our increasingly diversified economy.
We now need to consolidate it in order to achieve stronger growth rates.
Our ultimate goal is to achieve strong, lasting and inclusive growth, which would generate the desired impact on the quality of life, leading to attainment of the status of emerging economy by 2035.
To this end, I have prescribed profound reforms to enable us to make the most of our country’s abundant natural resources.
Additionally, we are constantly striving to make our debt burden more viable, more productive and more sustainable.
In this regard, I would like to commend the initiative taken by the International Monetary Fund, under your stewardship, to continue with global financial governance reforms.
It is my hope that the international community would adapt, as rapidly as possible, to the new demands of today and tomorrow.
Today’s world needs more effective and more active economic and financial solidarity than ever before.  
This is warranted by the interconnection of economies and the similarity of challenges encountered.
Failing such solidarity, the collapse of some will ultimately undermine the presumed or true solidity of others. The global economy is bound to a common destiny.
In that regard, Madam Managing Director, I would like to commend your personal commitment towards restoring overall global financial stability. You can count on Cameroon’s firm support.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I now invite you to raise your glasses in honour of Mrs Christine Lagarde, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, to her health as well as that of her beloved husband. To both I extend our very best wishes for the New Year. 
Thank you for your attention.

Members of the Diplomatic Corps,
It is always with much pleasure that I welcome you at the start of the year on the occasion of the solemn ceremony of presentation of New Year wishes. It is a great moment of communion.
I would like, The Dean of the Diplomatic Corps, to thank you sincerely for your encouragement and your kind words about Cameroon, your host country. I am pleased to receive your wishes for my country, my family and myself.
The Dean of the Diplomatic Corps,
The year that has just ended was marked by the exacerbation of terrorism and the slowdown of global growth.
A shady jihadist group that originated in the Middle East is spreading. Its adverse effects have extended to other regions, especially to Africa and Europe. 
The atrocities committed by the Islamic State, notably in Syria and Iraq, have caused great chaos in that part of the world.
In a bid to stem the chaos, an international coalition is carrying out air strikes designed to neutralize the Islamic State.
Cameroon supports all initiatives aimed at finding a lasting solution to this situation. For any compromise to be viable, it must take into account the legitimate political and economic interests of all the parties concerned.
These persistent tensions in Syria and Iraq are compounding the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
In Libya, the return to normalcy is still awaited. Our wish is for a National Unity Government that would accelerate its advent.
In the Sahel region, the jihadists remain active in Mali. The recent Bamako attacks serve as a reminder to us.
Our country, as you all can see, has been forced into a war against the Boko Haram sect for nearly two years now.
This shady terrorist sect, which claims to have pledged allegiance to the Islamic State in West Africa, has brought death and desolation around Lake Chad.
Cameroon has fiercely resisted this attempt at destabilization and violation of its territorial integrity.
Our Army, supported by the entire population, has not surrendered a single centimetre of our territory to the aggressors. 
Better still, it has, on many occasions inflicted severe military setbacks on them with their bases destroyed, equipment and material seized, hostages freed, prisoners taken and so on.
I would like to take this opportunity to solemnly thank those friendly countries which, through their support, have demonstrated their solidarity in this fight.
Having been routed on the war front, the Boko Haram terrorist group seems, for the time being, to have resigned itself to the hideous tactics of suicide attacks.
Cameroon welcomes the fact that the Multinational Joint Task Force is now operational and active on the ground.
Well beyond the Middle East and Africa, the deadly activities of jihadist terrorists reached Europe in 2015, taking numerous lives.
This development vindicates those who, from the very start, have been advocating for a global response to the said phenomenon, and this was rightly recalled earlier by the Dean of the Diplomatic Corps.
Terrorism can be defeated only through joint and resolute action by the international community. We need to pool our intelligence resources and our combat efforts.
In this fight, I believe it is also important to find suitable remedies to inequities and poverty which provide breeding ground for terrorism.
The United Nations and the international community should address them as a priority.
Another fall-out of the unstable situation in the Middle East is the displacement of hundreds of thousands of refugees.
Such migration of an unprecedented scale in modern history, places the European Union in a dilemma: stick to its humanistic ideals and host the migrants, or keep them on its periphery, or even send them back home.
On this issue of migrants, a distinction has recently emerged between war refugees from the Near East and the so-called economic migrants.
The former would be welcomed, while the latter would be held on the EU periphery, waiting to be sent back to their countries of origin.
Solutions to this difficult issue must be consistent with morality and human values.
In this regard, only human solidarity can provide reasonable solutions.
In Africa as well, conflicts and terrorist atrocities are causing large-scale migration. Cameroon, for instance, has been forced to host thousands of refugees mainly from the Central African Republic and Nigeria.
Faced with such an influx of helpless people, the only solution is human solidarity. We share the little you have, and we appeal for assistance. The essential thing is to fulfil our duty to mankind.
Distinguished Members of the Diplomatic Corps,
Security is rightfully an existential prerequisite for all peoples. Nevertheless, it is important to remember that only development, which is the new name for peace, can guarantee the survival of nations.
Today’s world has trouble fulfilling the required conditions for such inclusive development.
The world economy is marked by a significant slowdown of global growth.
There is a resultant decline in the economic performance of emerging countries and an abrupt end to a decade of good performances in developing countries.
African economies in particular have been weakened by their heavy dependence on global commodity markets.
Conversely, growth in developed countries is witnessing a slight increase.
This shift in zones of growth is due to the drastic fall in commodity prices, particularly oil, but also all other commodities.
To stay afloat, many developing countries, including Cameroon, have opted for economic diversification. Even then, victory is far from certain.
In fact, global economic and financial prospects point to the fact that the current deterioration in the terms of trade will continue.
A greater cause for concern is the progressive tightening of conditions for accessing international financing.
Under such circumstances, it is only through genuine international economic solidarity that any policy of economic diversification could succeed.
This applies to the economy and to other major topical global issues. International economic solidarity should hinge on two key pillars, namely shared prosperity and responsibility. 
With these principles, we can combat the globalization of indifference and build genuine world peace and brotherhood.
It was on the strength of such solidarity, and the awareness that we have a common destiny, that we travelled to Paris to attend the 21st Conference of the Parties on Climate Change.
International solidarity was strongly expressed here. The 195 participating countries undertook to curb global warming.
During COP21, Cameroon made a dual appeal to save Lake Chad and to preserve the Congo Basin. Mr Dean, we thank you for echoing this on behalf of members of the Diplomatic Corps.
At COP21, Cameroon committed itself to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 32%.
Hence, we will review some aspects of our development plan.
Such review requires substantial funding and the transfer of major technologies. This is another area for the expression of the new spirit of solidarity.
In this regard, we want to hail the promise made in Paris by industrialized countries.  They did renew their undertaking to provide developing countries USD 100 billion yearly.
This represents a milestone in resolving a problem that threatens the survival of mankind.
The United Nations crystallizes the ambition of peoples to build together lasting peace based on shared prosperity, effective solidarity, and respect for human values.
Such is the meaning of both the new commitment to peace and the new sustainable development agenda adopted in New York in September 2015 during the celebration of the 70th anniversary of the United Nations.
The Dean of the Diplomatic Corps,
Distinguished Members of the Diplomatic Corps,
I would be obliged if you would convey my wishes to the distinguished authorities that you so worthily represent here.
I also extend to you, your aides and your families, my most sincere wishes for happiness, health and success in 2016.
Long live international cooperation!
Long live Cameroon!
Thank you for your kind attention.

Heads of State and Government,
The Secretary-General of the United Nations,
Ladies and Gentlemen, 
I would like to first of all thank the French authorities and, especially, President François Hollande for the quality of their welcome. I also wish to congratulate them for the excellent organization of COP21 and their commitment to ensuring its success.
I would also like to congratulate the Secretary-General of the United Nations for his contribution to preparing this meeting which, undoubtedly, is one of the most important at this beginning of the millennium. 
In fact, our Conference addresses the urgent need to contain the adverse effects of climate change. It is our responsibility. It is our duty. And here, we have the opportunity.
To be credible, our conclusions and compromises must be binding. It is not an impossible task. Let us be guided simply by the requirement of human solidarity and proper appraisal of the urgency of the situation.
WE CANNOT AFFORD TO FAIL.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Although a low greenhouse gas-emitting country, Cameroon will continue to contribute to greenhouse gas emission reduction through the following:
- firstly, the plan to reduce carbon footprint by 32% by 2035 compared with 2010;
-    secondly, desertification control, preparation of a clean development mechanism, sustainable forest management and an action for the concerted management of the Congo Basin forests within the framework of the Central African Forests Commission;
- thirdly, sustainable water resource management in conjunction with the countries of the sub-region, members of the Lake Chad Basin Commission and the Niger Basin Authority.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
COP21 is expected to address two issues.
The first is the steady degradation of forests in Central Africa. Such degradation will decrease the contribution of these forests to greenhouse gas reduction.
WE MUST SAVE THE CONGO BASIN FORESTS. WE MUST SAVE THE SECOND LUNG OF THE PLANET.
Our second concern is desertification, which is affecting the neighbouring countries of Lake Chad.
That vast expanse of water, which is absolutely indispensable to the life of the population and biodiversity, is gradually drying up. It has already lost 90% of its initial surface area.
LET US SAVE LAKE CHAD.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
We are here to seek ways to meet the expectations and hopes of our peoples. Therefore, let us show determination and political courage. Yes, let us demonstrate audacity and wisdom.
If we succeed, the Paris Conference will go down in history as the decisive moment which the world, in its quest for the survival of mankind, has been clamouring for.
Thank you.

The Paris Conference on Climate Change is a historic opportunity for the international community to make commitments that are commensurate with the challenges faced. Together, we must contain the harmful effects of global warming.
It is true that the road from the Rio Summit in 1992 has been long, marked by the holding of  many conferences  in Kyoto, Bali, Copenhagen, Cancun, Durban, Doha, Warsaw and Lima. However, these efforts have not been in vain. Considered at first as the business of specialists, global warming has shaken the conscience of nations, their leaders and peoples. The question now is: what planet are we going to bequeath to future generations?
There is no doubt that climate change is caused by human activities as demonstrated by the 5th Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Although it has been clearly established that industrialized countries are more responsible for climate change than developing countries, that is not the issue. It is no longer time to apportion blame, but to act.  This global problem of climate change requires appropriate solutions from the international community.
All the preparatory work carried out in Lima, Bonn and Paris ahead of COP21 is an indication that we are moving towards a comprehensive and ambitious agreement to contain global warming by keeping global average temperature increase below 2°C by 2100.
We expect the ""Paris Agreement"" that will crown the deliberations of this conference to include compromises between national interests and those of the community of nations which are acceptable to all parties. To be credible, the commitments should be binding, especially with respect to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and provide for the establishment of appropriate financial and technological assistance mechanisms to support poor countries in their fight against climate disruptions.
Indeed, for many developing or emerging countries on the path to emergence, including Cameroon, greenhouse gas emission reduction remains predicated on support from the international community, especially the industrialized countries, in the form of funding, capacity building and technology transfer.
At the same time, it is necessary to draw up a financing schedule to ensure that partners in the agreement meet their commitments.
Similarly, it will be indispensable for the various funds, particularly the Green Fund, to be replenished by developed countries as planned and in a sustainable manner, without prejudice to grants awarded as official development assistance, and for access to funding sources to be simplified.
Cameroon intends to fully meet its commitment to reduce the carbon footprint of its development by 32% by 2035 compared with 2010.
Cameroon’s development policy, which seeks to achieve the status of emerging country by this same date, will certainly require climate change adaptation. At the international level, these mitigation measures will require technology transfers, maybe through a multilateral special fund. At the national level, the measures will also require us to harmonize our sector policies and scale up the efforts we have been making for several years now (reforestation as part of desertification control, designing a clean development mechanism, sustainable forest management and biodiversity conservation).
We must size up the real stakes of COP21 which are nothing short of ensuring the survival of mankind.
If participants demonstrate enough political courage to take obviously difficult but indispensable decisions to mobilize adequate resources and coordinate their efforts, then the Paris conference would have achieved its goal and marked a historic turning point.

The President of the General Conference,
The President of the Executive Council,
The Director General,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Let me begin by sincerely congratulating Minister Stanley MUTUMBA SIMATAA on his election as President of the 38th General Conference.
The President of the General Conference,
As we celebrate the 70th anniversary of the United Nations and its specialized agencies, including UNESCO, I am pleased to note that Africa is chairing this General Conference through your country. This is a strong sign that the world is changing positively.
The United Nations system in general, and UNESCO in particular, have contributed tremendously to this extraordinary change by supporting our continent’s political independence, the assertion of its personality and the preservation of its culture. Thus, a rejuvenated Africa has made a comeback to the community of nations.
Despite centuries of suffering and subordination, Africa has continued to believe and hope in humanity. It has brought to the community of nations its humanism marked by respect for the human person and dignity, a humanism of fraternity and solidarity. This explains its quest for a more just and more united new world order. Africa had no difficulty in adopting the ideals contained in the United Nations Charter and the UNESCO Constitution.  
Mr President, my country fathoms the weight of your responsibility from experience and assures you of its support.
Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,
Through me, Cameroon, which is pleased to participate in the celebration of the 70th anniversary of UNESCO, would like to heartily thank Mrs Irina BOKOVA, Director General of UNESCO, for her invitation. It is an honour and privilege to address this historic session.
I will start by recalling the special ties binding my country, UNESCO and the United Nations system. After the First World War, Cameroon was placed under the mandate of the League of Nations, and later under United Nations trusteeship. Under the auspices of the latter, it pursued its progress towards independence. Cameroon therefore rightly considers itself as an offspring of the United Nations and the international community. 
Within the large family of the United Nations system, Cameroon has a particular inclination towards UNESCO.
The reason is simple. As a peaceful and tolerant country inhabited by peoples of different origins, religions and cultural traditions, Cameroon shares UNESCO’s humanistic ideal the ultimate goal of which is to promote human “development” and harmony between peoples. Like UNESCO, Cameroon thinks that our differences, far from being a handicap, are a source of enrichment.
My country also shares the vision of lasting peace which is stated in the preamble of the Constitution of our organization which I would like to quote:
""Since wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the minds of men that the defences of peace must be constructed"". End of quote.
Harmony and understanding between peoples are closely linked to the recognition of and mutual respect for different cultures and their dialogue. The dissemination of education and the progress of science can but contribute to such values.
Fortunately, UNESCO has, since its inception, devoted itself to promoting these values. In fact, where war shows its ugly face, one can see the tragic consequences for the population and the cultural heritage of humanity. What is happening in Syria, Iraq and Mali is a vivid illustration.
Far from discouraging us, these deplorable examples should, instead, strengthen our resolve to defeat these destructive and backward ideologies.
My own country, which is a haven of stability, is now going through this painful experience. In recent years, it has suffered the terrorist attacks of Boko Haram. This sect is spreading grief and desolation in families, causing population displacement and the influx of refugees, and disrupting social and economic life in the Far-North Region of my country.
Worse still, this intolerant loose conglomeration is sowing seeds of ethnic and religious division, thus undermining the very foundations of our country which is its unity. The struggle to eradicate the sect compels us to devote huge resources to our defence at the expense of improving the living conditions of Cameroonians. The pooling of resources with our neighbours, the establishment of a joint African Union Multinational Force, and the valuable support provided by friendly powers, including France, will, I believe, enable us to crush this barbaric enemy soon.
I take this opportunity to recall that no country is safe from terrorist attacks. What has just happened in Paris in the evening of 13 November is very revealing. The war against terrorism concerns every nation that ranks respect for the human person and life among its core values. It is incumbent on every nation to make its contribution.
Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,
Over the past decades, we have received constant support from our foreign partners and international organizations. This support has helped us, over time, to build a democratic society and ensure our development. Our ambition is to achieve the status of an emerging country by 2035.
UNESCO occupies a privileged position among our partners. So, I would now like to say a few words concerning our cooperation with this organization.
In the area of education, UNESCO has contributed to implementing major projects such as the promotion of universal education, the fight against illiteracy, the enhancement of teaching methods, citizenship education and the modernization of our university system.
In the domain of science, UNESCO is helping us to improve environmental management and the functioning of the National Micro-science Centre.
Regarding culture and communication, we can proudly mention the building of the capacity of cultural actors and improvement of the management of protected areas, as well as the promotion of access to information.
This list is far from exhaustive as UNESCO’s achievements in my country are numerous and diverse. I also hail the establishment of the UNESCO Regional Office for Central Africa in Cameroon which will certainly strengthen its action in our sub-region.
I would like to end by expressing my deep appreciation for UNESCO’s activities in Cameroon under the stewardship of Irina BOKOVA. I would like to warmly congratulate and thank her and to inform her that her visit to my country last year remains etched in our memories.
Thank you for your attention.

Ministers of State, 
Ministers,
Ministers Delegate,
Secretaries of State,
We have just listened to some particularly edifying presentations.
I note with satisfaction that the Emergency Plan is definitely under way. I attach utmost importance to its implementation. Indeed, our people would like to see Cameroon transformed into a vast construction site through the Emergency Plan and our traditional development agenda. The people hope for better living conditions.
We must speed up preparations for the major sporting events which are the 2016 and 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON).
The Emergency Plan and the hosting of the AFCON competitions are major challenges which the government must meet.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is an honour to serve one’s country as a Member of Government. But it is also, and above all, a RESPONSIBILITY, A HUGE RESPONSIBILITY, which I, therefore, urge you to fully assume and make Government’s action more effective and EFFICIENT.
I have said it before and I am saying it again, we have a long-term vision which should enable us to achieve the status of emerging country by 2035.
We have a Growth and Employment Strategy Paper which seeks to modernize our country and improve the living conditions of the Cameroonian people.
Lastly, we have an Emergency Plan to address urgent needs.
As you can see, the framework has thus been laid down, and goals have been set and are known. We must resolutely pursue our action. I wish to state this clearly. We must do more. We must do better.
In the coming months, it is obvious that the Government’s top priorities will still be to defend our country against the Boko Haram threat and its atrocities, as well as preserve our internal security. In that connection, it will ensure continuity in its action.
I take this opportunity to once more extend my appreciation to our defence and security forces for their commitment to protecting our territorial integrity.
Thanks to their courage and professionalism, the Boko Haram terrorists have suffered many setbacks. They are now in a difficult situation. With their backs to the wall, they are now using cowardly weapons, that is, gruesome suicide attacks against innocent civilians.
I have issued appropriate instructions to our defence and security forces to help them adapt to this new form of aggression. They have been recording indisputable successes daily on this new front. I congratulate them.
I would also like to thank and warmly congratulate our valiant populations for their patriotism and resolve to keep the terrorists at bay. They have been providing valuable and effective assistance to our defence and security forces through vigilante groups. We will continue to lend them our full support.
Let this be very clear. Protecting our people and their property remains our top priority. I will spare no effort in this regard.
Government’s second priority is to do everything possible to maintain or even increase our growth rate. It is true that the fall in oil prices and the budgetary effort made to ensure our protection will complicate our task, but I believe that we have some growth-supporting reserves.
If we attain our goals in terms of:
power generation,
tapping our mineral resources,
building our transport infrastructure,
modernizing our agriculture,
kick-starting our second generation industrialization, etc.,
I am convinced that we can overcome all the other difficulties.
But this will require the Government to correct lingering shortcomings here and there.
It will be necessary to ensure better coordination between ministries.
It will also be necessary to ensure better organization within ministries. I am thinking here of greater involvement of Ministers Delegate and Secretaries of State.
Similarly, efforts should be made to speed up project maturation and eliminate unjustified deadlocks.
It will also be necessary to address the issue of under-utilization of appropriations which undermines our economic recovery efforts.
In the same vein, it will be essential to continue ensuring quality public spending.
Lastly, you should constantly apply the following principles which are the driving force of Senior State Servants and nation-builders: discipline, team spirit, dedication, loyalty, integrity and patriotism.
A lot has been done in recent years. Perhaps we have not been talking enough about it. But we must not rest on our laurels. Development is a perpetual process, and we have so much to do!
Not so long ago, I said that the Government team should see itself as a “Government with a mission”. This meant that it was not appointed to deal with routine business, but to invent, create and implement. Today, more than ever before, I reiterate that instruction; because that is what the Cameroonian people expect, and because that is what we owe the people.
Thank you for your attention.

•Ministers of State,
•Ministers,
•Ministers Delegate,
•Secretaries of State,
Before I get into the crux of the matter, let me first of all recall the sad events that occurred during the recent pilgrimage to Mecca which plunged our country into mourning.
In fact, on 24 September 2015, a huge stampede occurred in Mecca leaving many pilgrims dead or injured. Information at our disposal today indicates that 76 of our compatriots died in the stampede. As I speak, some thirty others are still unaccounted for. Our diplomatic missions on the spot are searching for them in collaboration with Saudi authorities.
Once more I wish to extend to the bereaved families my most sincere condolences as well as those of the entire Nation.
I have dispatched a Special Envoy to Saudi Arabia to deliver to our pilgrims the Nation’s message of comfort and solidarity.
I have ordered the disbursement of special assistance for the injured and the affected families.
I have also declared 16 October 2015 a national day of mourning.
I now invite you to rise and observe a moment of silence in memory of those who lost their lives during this event.
Thank you.

The Cameroonian people, my wife and I are very pleased and proud to welcome you to Yaounde this day. You are on a maiden visit to Cameroon following your election to the highest office of Nigeria, a neighbouring and brotherly country with which we have always shared strong and indestructible ties created by our geographic closeness and by History.
I therefore wish you and your delegation a warm welcome to and a pleasant and fruitful stay in Cameroon.
Permit me, on behalf of the Cameroonian people and on my personal behalf, to avail myself of this solemn occasion to once more heartily congratulate you on your recent election which, today, requires you to preside over the destiny of your great nation.
Mr President,
A dark cloud is looming over our countries even as we welcome you. We are facing the same threat which may rock the very foundations of our two Nations. This danger bears the name Boko Haram. 
Its atrocities and crimes are jeopardizing social peace around Lake Chad and, especially, in our two countries. 
The number of deaths and victims is rising. Economic activities have been crippled in affected areas. The number of refugees and displaced persons is ever-increasing.
We cannot allow this canker to spread. We must pool our resources and forces, and share our experiences.
I fathom your determination to put an end to BOKO Haram activities on Nigerian territory and to cooperate with the other affected countries.
I therefore pay deserved tribute to the initiatives you have taken in that connection. 
Rest assured of Cameroon’s total, constant and unfailing commitment in this just and noble struggle. Our intransigence is matched only by the determination to ensure that our peoples continue to live in the peace and tranquility they have always known until recently.
As soon as the terrorist threat was felt at our border, I took important measures to step up the operational capacity of our defence and security forces. 
These measures added to an exemplary and dynamic international cooperation that we hail today.
Friendly and brotherly countries like Chad, Niger, responded with great solidarity to the measures which enjoyed and still enjoy the support of our close-knit and unanimous peoples.
As I have already stated in other occasions, and we all agree, terrorism is today a global threat and only a global response can stamp it out. 
The future of our States, the prosperity and wellbeing of our peoples, as well as world peace depend on it.
The seriousness of the security issues I have just raised should not dampen our determination to pursue the excellent diversified bilateral cooperation ties existing between our two countries.
We have established various cooperation platforms besides the many informal transactions carried out between our peoples. I believe that through these platforms, we can now implement even more common-interest cross-border projects to improve the living conditions of our respective peoples and transform our zone into an area of inclusive prosperity.
I am therefore appealing, Mr President, for a fresh push to economic ties between our two countries to ensure greater solidarity and complementarity. In the same vein, we should ease trade between our two countries and encourage more joint ventures involving our economic operators.
I strongly believe in your readiness to work towards that goal, and your visit to Cameroon as well as the discussions we have had have strengthened my conviction. 
Mr President, 
Ladies and Gentlemen, 
My wife and I now invite you to raise your glasses:
-      in honour of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, His Excellency Muhammadu BUHARI ;
-      to the strengthening of secular ties between Nigeria and Cameroon;
-      to peace, concord and the prosperity of our brotherly peoples!
Thank you.

My Wife and I are pleased to welcome you to Cameroon, more especially, to this building which symbolizes the unity of our country and our people.
I welcome you with great pleasure in the name of the relationship that is etched in time, and the strong and true friendship existing between France and Cameroon, the French people and the Cameroonian people.
Your visit is a special honour to the Cameroonian people. It bears testimony to the long-standing and strong friendship binding our two countries.
Mr President,
From history and from my experience of relations between men and between States, I have learnt that what matters most between friends is not the time   spent together.
I strongly believe that what matters most is the mutual respect friends have for each other, the quality, depth, sincerity and richness of the ties.
The relationship between Cameroon and France is special, and even singular and deeply rooted in time.
It must be recalled that France was here before Cameroon’s independence. It was from Cameroon, the first territory to join free France, that French troops stationed in Equatorial Africa set out to re-conquer and liberate France. In that struggle, Cameroonians shed their blood.
When the German protectorate ended, France and Great Britain first ruled Cameroon as a mandated territory under the League of Nations and then as a trust territory under the United Nations. France therefore witnessed our aspirations for sovereignty.
As a key witness to our quest for freedom, France knows the history of our struggle for independence and is aware of the high price that Cameroonians paid. It is not France, which has journeyed with us since our independence, that will be tutored on why Cameroonians hold their national unity so dear.
Cameroon’s unity has been built on   its geographical, ethnic and cultural diversity. It is such diversity that gives my country its rich and varied character. The distinctive pride of my compatriots is also due to this diversity.
Mr President,
With valuable help from friendly countries, including France, we have laid the foundations of a free, democratic and prosperous Cameroon.
France supports our efforts to build a modern State. Hence, it is only normal for us to count on our ally of all times, both in our march towards emergence and in our crusade against corruption, terrorism and insecurity. 
Mr President,
We cannot fail to mention the significant progress we have achieved in promoting democracy, the rule of law, freedom of speech, and human rights protection. We have also been able to progressively establish credible institutions. However, as in all endeavours, the learning process, which took several centuries in old democracies, has not always been without hurdles.
What is indisputable is the democratic culture which is becoming deeply rooted in Cameroon. However, we remain cautious in order to avoid highlighting, all too often, the downside more than the upside.
Current events clearly show that our relationship is marked by frankness, pragmatism and realism. Who would dare affirm that, even so, the relationship is not at its best?
For my part, I avail myself of this opportunity to salute the excellent cooperation and friendship ties existing between us and between our peoples. 
This friendship is invaluable for us at a time when our planet has to deal with terrorism, the immigration peril, violence, global warming and, it must be acknowledged, a lingering economic crisis.
Human aspiration for more freedom and the enjoyment of innovation is legitimate. Unfortunately, all too often, it leads to tragic disillusionment. Therefore, the concerted action of States seems to be the only way out; provided, this time around, human dignity takes centre stage in every activity. This is absolutely a moral imperative, given that the human person must never cease being the rationale behind everything.   
Such are Cameroon’s opinion and vision.
Mr President,
At the end of the last century, my country was hard hit by a severe economic crisis. Frankly, coming out of the crisis was no easy task. By the way, we still bear the stigma of structural adjustment and, somehow, the burden of accumulated debt. Support from our friends and multilateral partners helped to boost our own efforts and ease our sacrifices.
In the new dispensation, Cameroon sought to consolidate its traditional relations with its long-standing partners. At the same time, we have resolutely embarked on diversifying our partnerships, as the global environment is now more open to competition.
Mr President,
In terms of security, France’s action is and remains paramount and crucial especially within the United Nations Security Council. Your commitment to peace preservation and crisis and conflict resolution, especially in Africa, has remained constant. In Mali, it is mainly thanks to France that there is now hope for a return to normalcy. Even closer to us, your country is making a very valuable and highly appreciated contribution towards restoring Statehood in the Central African Republic and stamping out Boko Haram.
Mr President,
As you know, Cameroon is not only waging a war against the Boko Haram sect, but is also affected in many ways by the crisis in the Central African Republic. In terms of humanitarian needs, the atrocities committed in this country have led to population displacement and an influx of refugees. Several French nationals were taken hostage due to this situation. Fortunately, they have all been released, thanks to the concerted and effective action of our services. It is in no one’s interest for chaos, which breeds insecurity, jihadism and various forms of fundamentalism, to take hold of the Heart of Africa, a continent of opportunities.
I believe this is the appropriate time for France to continue its all-out lobbying of other great powers. We believe the UN Security Council should make a firm commitment to ending this tragedy.
Cameroon hails you as a President with firm convictions and a strong sense of justice. Know that, like you, we believe that more needs to be done to address the root causes of various scourges. 
This applies more specifically to misery and poverty, breeding grounds for uncontrolled migration and various forms of fundamentalism.
I welcome the holding in Paris next December of the summit on global warming which is affecting us in Africa.
I therefore accept your kind invitation to come to Paris. 
Before I conclude, allow me to extend greetings to the members of the delegation accompanying President HOLLANDE and to wish them a pleasant stay among us. These are ladies and gentlemen who, I know, are working selflessly for successful cooperation between our two countries.
My wife and I now invite you to raise your glasses in honour of the President of the French Republic, Mr. François HOLLANDE and to France-Cameroon friendship.
Thank you.

I would like to first of all welcome you. The Cameroonian people and I are very pleased to receive the President of the French Republic, Mr François Hollande
We wish to place this visit under the banner of friendship to which President François Hollande’s presence today in our midst on a State visit bears eloquent testimony. It is therefore normal that we have had cordial discussions and convergent views on the issues discussed. 
Ladies and Gentlemen, 
The fight against Boko Haram featured prominently in our discussions. The recent deadly attacks in Nigeria and Chad are part of the long list of atrocities committed by this terrorist group which has continued to wreak death and destruction in Nigeria, Niger, Chad and Cameroon in recent months. The need for the countries concerned and the international community to pool efforts in order to end this senseless killing has never been stronger. Cameroon has remained steadfast in the face of attacks by this barbarous sect. 
I commend the bravery and commitment of our soldiers who have inflicted heavy defeats on the enemy and preserved our territorial integrity. I pay tribute to our population for demonstrating admirable commitment, cohesion and solidarity. I want to state here that we will spare no effort to protect our territory and population, and prevent these obscurantist forces from halting our march towards progress.
I expressed our heartfelt gratitude to President Hollande for the support France has given and continues to give us in this struggle. I seize this opportunity to sincerely thank the other countries and international organizations for their support. Such support is even more precious to us as we have to address many security, economic and humanitarian challenges against the backdrop of this crisis.  
At the regional level, I reiterated to President Hollande Cameroon’s appreciation for France’s beneficial interventions in Mali and the Central African Republic which have helped to prevent the deterioration of the security situation and create conditions conducive to the resumption of dialogue between the warring factions. 
Obviously, we also discussed the political situation in Cameroon. In this respect, I briefed President Hollande on the progress made in consolidating our democracy, especially the ongoing establishment of the institutions provided for by the Constitution, the regular organization of elections, the promotion of human rights and freedoms, etc. 
I also briefed him on our determination to pursue efforts regarding governance, the fight against the embezzlement of public funds, the reduction of delays in the administration of justice and the improvement of the business climate. We reaffirmed our mutual commitment to the freedom of expression which is a reality in Cameroon with the proliferation and vitality of newspapers. However, efforts will be made by the Government, and by journalists themselves, to limit excesses. 
Economically, Cameroon is pursuing its development efforts with the stated aim of becoming an emerging country. I lauded the support we are receiving from France in this respect. The successful implementation of the Debt Relief and Development Contract (C2D) and the presence of many French enterprises in Cameroon are eloquent proof of the dynamism, solidarity and solidity of our partnership. 
President Hollande and I examined the issue of migration and its attendant human tragedies in recent years. This is a complex issue whose solution is not so simple. The international community should continue to explore ways and means of providing more prospects to migrants and aspiring migrants. 
The upcoming United Nations Climate Change Conference which will be hosted by France was also discussed. I commended President Hollande’s leadership on these key issues. Cameroon will participate in this struggle to preserve our planet. 
Ladies and gentlemen of the press, those are some of my conclusions from our discussions this evening. It goes without saying that I am at your disposal to answer any questions.",https://prc.cm/en/news/speeches-of-the-president/1259-speech-by-his-excellency-mr-paul-biya-commander-in-chief-of-the-armed-forces-during-the-graduation-ceremony-of-the-lieutenant-youssouf-mahamat-bahar-and-fiftieth-anniversary-of-reunification-batches-of-the-combined-services-academy-yaounde-24-april-2015

The President of the Economic and Social Council,
The First President and Procureur General of the Supreme Court,
Ministers,
Members of the Diplomatic Corps,
Generals,
Officers, Petty Officers, Non-Commissioned Officers and Soldiers,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
This ceremony is taking place at a special moment in Cameroon’s history. Our country is waging a merciless war against an enemy that is posing a threat to our territorial integrity, our lifestyle and our people.
Before I continue, please rise and let us observe a minute of silence in memory of our brave soldiers who fell defending our Fatherland, and in memory of our compatriots who were victims of atrocities perpetrated by the Boko Haram sect.
(… Thank you)
Young Officers of the “Lieutenant YOUSSOUF MAHAMAT BAHAR” and “Fiftieth Anniversary of Reunification” Batches,
I am very pleased today to preside over your graduation ceremony as is customary.
You have opted to pursue one of the best professions, the military profession, which affords you the opportunity to serve the Fatherland in a spirit of selflessness and sacrifice.
The names you have chosen to christen your batches following your training at the Combined Services Academy are particularly evocative.
Lieutenant YOUSSOUF MAHAMAT BAHAR bequeaths to posterity the indelible memory of a young officer who lost his life after neutralizing the entire group of attackers in the course of a dangerous operation he led at sea against a gang of pirates.
The Fiftieth Anniversary of Reunification, which was celebrated with pomp and solemnity on 20 February 2014 in Buea, will go down in history as the commemoration of the fierce determination of the Cameroonian people to regain its unity.
In your career as officers, the names of your two batches should constantly serve as references in the discharge of your duties. Lieutenant YOUSSOUF MAHAMAT BAHAR’s example will serve as a challenge and a permanent call to attain the highest level of patriotism and sense of sacrifice, while the Fiftieth Anniversary of Reunification will remind you of the absolute imperative to defend our national unity and territorial integrity.
Young Officers of the “Lieutenant YOUSSOUF MAHAMAT BAHAR” and “Fiftieth Anniversary of Reunification” Batches,
This graduation ceremony is undoubtedly a milestone in your lives. It confirms your accession to the military career, one that is definitely demanding, but no less exciting.
This graduation also crowns three years of efforts made by each and every one of you at the Combined Services Academy.
On behalf of the entire Nation, I am pleased to warmly congratulate you, before   the military hierarchy and your respective families.
I equally hail the success of your comrades from Gabon, the Central African Republic, Mali, Niger, Benin and Senegal. Their presence in your midst is testimony to their countries’ confidence in the quality of your school’s label and, obviously, the excellent ties binding us.
I also wish to extend my profound gratitude to your academy’s Training Command as well as all the civil and military instructors that accompanied you with competence and devotion throughout your training.
Lastly, I regretfully salute the memory of one of your comrades, Lieutenant DONKENG Joseph Kevin, who died alongside other soldiers during an attack by the Boko Haram terrorist group on 25 July 2014 at Bargaram in the Far-North Region.
Young Officers of the “Lieutenant YOUSSOUF MAHAMAT BAHAR” and ""Fiftieth Anniversary of Reunification” Batches, 
As I said, this ceremony is taking place under special circumstances. It is usually an occasion for the graduands, their families and loved ones to express legitimate pride and joy. This year, it is naturally tinged with a feeling of gravity at the thought of those killed in action or wounded in battle.
We must constantly bear in mind that our brave soldiers are engaged in a real war imposed on us by a merciless enemy who defies the laws of humanity.
We therefore had to defend ourselves against aggression of all types. Such is the primary mission of our armed forces:  to defend the Nation. It should be underscored that our soldiers have done better than defending themselves and defending us. 
They have inflicted huge losses on the enemy and compelled him to leave our territory. I pay tribute to their courage and spirit of sacrifice. They have won our esteem…, they have won our admiration.
Only a ""republican"" army whose action is rooted in the fundamental values freely chosen by the people can perform such feats. Such is the case of our defence forces which are an emanation of our people and, like all of us, hold dear our conception of a society of freedom, social justice and tolerance. 
For their part, the Cameroonian people in their great wisdom clearly understood that it was their very existence as a people that was under threat. And obviously, they could not accept that.
From North to South and from East to West, Cameroonians have mobilized massively, and are still mobilizing enthusiastically and spontaneously, to make their generous contribution to the war effort in a remarkable show of solidarity. 
I wish, here and now, to pay our people a glowing tribute for this undivided support to our defence forces. As Head of State and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, I congratulate them on this impressive show of patriotism. I encourage our people to keep up this noble spirit.
 We also commend the unreserved support received from the international community. It has understood that what is really at stake in our struggle is human dignity. It has also understood that a single State cannot overcome the security challenges of today’s world, namely terrorism, piracy, arms proliferation and drug trafficking. These threats transcend State boundaries. They require from our countries a concerted operational response within the framework of a subregional, regional and even international coalition. 
I take this opportunity to note and commend the historic decision of my brother and friend His Excellency Idriss DEBY ITNO, President of the Republic of Chad, who, as you are aware, engaged a large Chadian military contingent to fight against Boko Haram alongside Cameroon. We will always remember that.
I will conclude by inviting you, once again, to spare a compassionate thought for our soldiers killed in action and for their families. The Nation will forever be grateful to them. 
Young officers of the ""Lieutenant YOUSSOUF MAHAMAT BAHAR"" and ""Fiftieth Anniversary of Reunification"" Batches,
Your mission is crystal clear.
I am convinced that you will accomplish it with the full strength of your patriotic commitment, with Honour and Loyalty.
You can count on my constant solicitude and total support from the Cameroonian people.
Long live Cameroon’s Defence Forces!
Long live Cameroon!

The Cameroonian people, my wife and I are very pleased to have you in our country. Welcome to Cameroon.
Before addressing the lady who is currently at the helm of the International Organization of La Francophonie, I would like to say a few words to an exceptional woman.
Following an outstanding academic career, you had a brilliant stint in your country’s media. It is no surprise that such varied experience qualified you for the prestigious post of Governor General of Canada, making you ipso facto a Head of State. At the end of your tenure, you accepted to undertake many humanitarian missions to Haiti to which you have naturally remained much attached. Your success in the said missions was universally recognized and commended.
As a widely respected woman of action and conviction, your candidacy for the post of Secretary-General of the International Organization of La Francophonie, which was put forward by your Government, was approved by consensus in November 2014 in Dakar. That decision, which makes you the first woman to hold this high office, pays tribute to your personal record. It also recognizes Canada’s prominent role in the francophone world.
As an African, I can only be pleased with your appointment. You are familiar with our continent, which you have visited many times. Like me, you are aware that the French language we share is among the five most spoken languages worldwide and particularly in Africa. If demographers’ projections are correct, in 2050, Africa’s population will be approximately one billion seven hundred million, and the majority French-speaking.
The bulk of our Organization’s members are still developing countries. Some, if not the majority, belong to the so-called least developed countries. This is why, in Dakar, I advocated that the solidarity amongst us should be tangible, ongoing and sustainable in terms of development. It was in the same vein that in Montreux, I proposed the establishment of a solidarity fund for disaster-stricken countries.
Madam Secretary-General, as you are aware, contrary to our commitments, the Millennium Development Goals have not been achieved. The Post-2015 Agenda will take over. It is imperative to close the huge gap. In so doing, we will roll back poverty which is the crucible of extremism and rebellion.
In this struggle for human dignity, the International Organization of La Francophonie has its role to play. Its new strategic framework is a valuable asset to this end. By advocating more active solidarity for least developed countries, our organization will contribute towards reducing inequalities between the North and the South.
French is the main link between member countries of the International Organization of La Francophonie. Our Organization should not be a “closed world”. How could it be otherwise? Many of its member countries, particularly Canada and Cameroon, belong to other like-minded bodies. Such being the case, I see no reason why such bodies should not work together or pursue common goals such as peace, democracy and economic and social progress. In this regard, I wish to hail the ever-increasing opening up of our Organization to countries belonging to other linguistic and cultural spheres. I am referring to Arabic-speaking, English-speaking and Portuguese-speaking countries.
We hail our Organization’s contribution to the advent of the future civilization, the universal civilization.
The Secretary-General of the International Organization of La Francophonie,
To conclude, I would like to thank you for your visit which comes a few months following your accession to the helm of our Organization. During your meetings, you will surely discover that we have a lot in common.
I will add that you have a huge task. Your distinguished academic career and your record as an admired stateswoman augur well for the successful discharge of your duties. You can count on Cameroon’s as well as my own personal support.
Ladies and Gentlemen, 
My wife and I now invite you to raise your glasses to that success and in honour of Ms Michaëlle Jean, Secretary-General of the International Organization of La Francophonie.
Thank you!

•Ladies and Gentlemen,
On behalf of the Cameroonian people, I wish you a warm welcome and pleasant stay in Yaoundé. I would like to heartily thank you for attending this summit. 
Just as you desired, this summit is devoted to attacks on some of our countries by the Boko Haram terrorist sect. Your presence here testifies to the solidarity within our Organization. Above all, it also reflects our determination to implement the various decisions we have already taken against Boko Haram, a movement which, as you are aware, rebuffs the values of human life. It uses methods of blind and ruthless terrorism.
Its atrocities have already claimed thousands of lives – Muslims for the most part – and caused extensive property damage in Nigeria and in neighbouring countries. 
Chad, Niger and Cameroon, and of course Nigeria, are currently at the front line, so to say. Their armed forces are bravely waging battle… Needless to point out that their battle is also the battle of our entire Organization.
I would like to pay fraternal tribute to President Idriss DEBY. With the support of the Chadian people and as a sign of solidarity, he took the courageous decision to send a large contingent of Chadian soldiers to reinforce our troops. Their bravery is well known and has been demonstrated in the latest battles.
Furthermore, Cameroon commends the decision taken by the African Union at end-January 2015. 
As you know, the African Union’s Council for Peace and Security in Central Africa, at its meeting of Heads of State and Government, authorized the deployment of a 7 500-man strong Mixed Multinational Force. It also decided to convene an experts’ meeting in Yaounde from 5 to 7 February 2015 to specify the operational concept of this force. The meeting   conducted an in-depth situation analysis   and prepared the mandate of the Mixed Multinational Force. 
The African Union’s decision also paves the way for referral to the Security Council with a view to adopting a resolution. 
Permit me to point out, once again, that this is in no way whatsoever, a “crusade” against Islam or an episode in some kind of “clash of civilizations”. 
The reality is simple.  On one side, there are our forces, defenders of a modern and tolerant society which guarantees the exercise of human rights, including that of religion, as well as representative democracy. On the other side, namely Boko Haram and similar movements, there are partisans of an obscurantist and tyrannical society which has no consideration for human dignity.
You would agree with me that these two models of society are absolutely incompatible and, hence, compromise is absolutely impossible.
Therefore, we need to put an end to the actions and activities of terrorist movements. We need to eradicate Boko Haram. By so doing, we would be able to reassure our populations and better focus on the only worthwhile struggle: the struggle against poverty and for the dignity of Africans. 
Thank you.

In my address to you at this same time last year, I gave you a glimpse of our renewed economic growth and, of course, positive job creation prospects. Well, this recovery was confirmed in the course of last year. There are statistics to prove it.
As I mentioned in my 2014 end-of-year message, 283 443 jobs have been created by government services and enterprises. In 2015, we expect 350 000 new jobs to be created. At this time next year, we will have the opportunity to take stock of all the jobs created since 2011.
Obviously, this is commendable. However, we must also recognize that we are far from a glorious sustainable recovery that can alone transform our country into an eldorado.  
Such bright spell must be sustainable and consolidated to lead to economic emergence. At any rate, our youth will continue to reap its benefits.  
I am well aware that many of you, whether educated or not, are unemployed. I am well aware that to survive, many of you resort to precarious options that are unrelated to your training or qualification. 
This situation is in several cases due to the global context as well as our educational system.
For nearly twenty years, unfair terms of trade and successive economic and financial crises have slowed down our development process and thus made job opportunities scarce.
Another possible cause is the delay in gearing our educational system towards professionalization. 
For a long time, we believed that it sufficed to make education accessible to the greatest number and continually raise its level, to mechanically resolve the unemployment problem. 
Our primary, secondary and high schools, universities and professional schools must constantly adapt to the changing world. In our quest for development, we should be guided by the need to train youths who are capable of building our country.
Technological advancement has changed the way things are done. The new economy is computer-dominated. We should focus on training technicians and engineers. The ongoing professionalization of secondary and higher education seeks to meet this requirement. In this light, manual labour, which has been neglected, will definitely need to be given its deserved place from primary school.
In a country like ours, whose ambitions in the areas of agriculture, mining, tourism, arts, sports and the environment are an open secret, and where handicraft and small enterprises still occupy a prominent position, it is indispensable to have better training institutions that prepare our youth for these trades.
These sectors are real niches for growth and skilled jobs such as plumbing, electricity and motor and industrial mechanics.
Industrialization, especially key anchor projects and our agricultural policy will only increase our needs in these specialties. Needless to point out that in more advanced countries, such trades are often better paid than those in the business and service sectors.
From that perspective, given the relatively recent adoption of professionalization of education in Cameroon, its impact on employment will definitely not be immediate.  
You might then ask me: given the urgency and the fact that youth are naturally impatient, what do we do and how?
I urge the Government to use the existing structures to continue providing vocational training, promoting self-employment and micro-project financing. I also urge every trades chamber, employers’ organization, in short, the private sector, to pull its own weight.
Dear young compatriots,
Our country’s ongoing and    irreversible transformation is only possible with you, and for you.
How could it be otherwise when the youth represent one half of our population?
The youth are also known to be passionate. That, I understand. However, they should show some moderation in their drive and be realistic. 
Do not be misled notably by birds of ill omen, dreamers and enthusiasts of virtual calls for destabilization through the social networks. These irresponsible prophets are desperately seeking to manipulate you.
Never has our national cohesion been as indispensable as during this delicate period when our country is facing external threat from barbaric enemies. 
It is not at a time when our nation’s outlook is bright that we should listen to calls for division and destabilization.
Dear young compatriots,
I have always trusted you. I know you treasure our unity. I know you cherish peace, progress and justice. I also know your good sense and your pragmatism. 
I am certain that the horrific scenes being witnessed in some countries torn by civil war, religious conflicts, population displacements and anarchy will deter you from getting involved in such adventures.
Take the example of our young soldiers who are ensuring our security along our borders.  Their bravery, their sense of duty and sacrifice show us what utmost love for fatherland can be.
The war they are waging on our behalf, at the risk of their lives, involves the entire Nation. There is no doubt that with the support of us all, we will emerge victorious. Friendly countries that cherish peace and freedom, the international community and world opinion are on our side.
Happy Youth Day to all of you!
Long live the Cameroonian youth!
Long live Cameroon!

•Ambassadors and High Commissioners,
•Representatives of international organizations,
If we were to consider only the proliferation of pockets of tension or armed conflict, we might be tempted to conclude that 2014 was not a good year. On the other hand, we cannot fail to acknowledge that the global economy showed signs of recovery in some parts of the world. This does not, however, mean that the crisis is behind us. In fact, many countries are experiencing an economic slowdown or even stagnation.
Let us take a closer look at the situation.
Unquestionably, the situation in the Middle East has worsened. The Islamic State’s stranglehold on northern Syria and Iraq and its attacks on the Damascus and Baghdad regimes have plunged the region into great chaos. The struggle for power has been compounded by religious or ethnic clashes, pitting Sunnis against Shiites, Muslims against Christians, Arabs against Kurds, etc. The toll is horrendous: destruction, slaughter of innocent people, flight and displacement of populations, weakening of neighbouring States, etc.
The airstrikes launched by the “coalition” appear to have slowed the advance of Islamic State fighters. However, given that the fielding of coalition personnel is ruled out and that for the time being, the United Nations Organization is not directly involved, no prospects for a settlement are in sight. The overriding impression is one of a horrible mess.
Developments in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are hardly more encouraging. The negotiations initiated have stalled. While the Palestinian Authority seems to have given up mending fences with Hamas and its recognition as a State seems to be gaining ground, there is an escalation in incidents between Israelis and Palestinians, raising fears about the outbreak of another “Intifada”. As time goes by, the prospect of the mutual recognition of the right of both States to exist seems to be fading. How many more tragedies will it take before reason finally prevails?
In the north of our continent, the “Arab springs” have met with varying fortunes. The peaceful outcome of the democratic transition in Tunisia in keeping with the freely expressed will of the people is reason for satisfaction.
Furthermore, one can only hope that a great country like Egypt would return to the path of national concord so that it may play its role on the world scene. For its part, Libya, which is currently torn among multiple factions, can regain its rightful position only if it successfully transcends its cleavages and rebuilds the foundations of its national unity.
Even the “old continent” could not preserve hard-won peace, after enduring the ravages of two world wars. Of course, I am referring to Ukraine, where there is an ongoing fratricidal war whose global repercussions instil the fear of a return to the cold war. No one would benefit from such a prospect. The big powers are duty-bound to use their influence to quell tension between the protagonists and convince them to resume dialogue.
However, permit me to revisit an issue affecting us more closely. In my message to the Nation a few days ago, I mentioned the escalation of attacks by Boko Haram in the northern part of my country and how we have responded.
As you are aware, we have beefed up our defence forces in the region concerned by taking measures to protect our population against repeated terrorist attacks and maintain our territorial integrity. As in many other countries around the world confronted by such threats, we have adopted laws and regulations   to prevent and stamp out terrorism. Such is the purport of the law recently passed by Parliament. The law has been welcomed by the large majority of the Cameroonian people who clearly understand its rationale.
Today, I would like to underscore the global nature of the threat we are facing.
Those who tried to subjugate Mali, those who sporadically carry out raids into our country, those who probably influenced some factions in the Central African Republic and those who created chaos in Somalia have the same goals: to establish their authority on the Sahel strip from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean and set up their ruthless obscurantist regime therein.
A global threat calls for a global response. Such should be the response of the international community, including the African Union and our regional organizations. We must not delude ourselves. Although weakened by the losses it has suffered, our foe nonetheless remains capable of bouncing back. Its raids in northern Mali and the repeated attacks launched against our territory should convince us of this fact. We must bear in mind that the distance separating a country from the combat zones is no sure-fire guarantee of safety.
Personally, I still believe that the threat posed by Jihadists, Boko Haram and Shebabs may be defeated only through global mobilization. Many have understood this, but are yet to draw lessons from it. I would like to commend the multi-faceted support provided by the United Nations organization, but also some big powers, notably the United States of America, France, the United Kingdom, China, Russia and Germany. We thank them for their firm determination to stand by us in this struggle.
Let me now say a few words about my country’s economic outlook within a highly varied global context. Following a recent mission to Cameroon, the IMF commended our efforts, while urging us to continue with our structural reforms and maintain our fiscal discipline.
However, we must also take into account the rather unstable international environment. In the documents prepared during its most recent General Assembly, the international financial organization   forecasts that recovery, particularly in Europe, which is one of our leading partners, will be “weak” and “unbalanced”. The IMF is concerned about the “record high” level of the public debt of rich countries and does not rule out the likelihood of a third recession. 
The outlook in countries that recorded average growth is uncertain. Furthermore, there is a significant slowdown in the economies of emerging countries. Markets for their part have periodically been edgy.
In such a context, we have no choice but to pursue our growth-based policy which, as you know, hinges on three main pillars, namely:
-development of infrastructure, notably transport and energy;
-modernization of our agriculture; and
-development of industries to process our raw materials. 
By so doing, we hope to roll back poverty by creating jobs and improving the living conditions of our populations. By the same token, we will be better-positioned to resist any decline in global economic growth.
Fortunately, the picture I am painting is not entirely bleak. Some parts of the world are more resistant to the economic slowdown than others. Such is the case of the United States of America which is experiencing renewed growth, with employment spin-offs. Much to our satisfaction, this applies to Africa as well.
On the other hand, the international community is very concerned about the Post-2015 Development Agenda that will replace the Millennium Development Goals which, as we are aware, are far from being achieved. The last session of the United Nations General Assembly focused on this problem. We can reasonably hope that the new system that will replace the Millennium Development Goals will better reflect the aspirations and needs of the populations concerned and will hence be more effective.
Global warming which also constitutes a major issue was the theme of a summit held in New York on the sidelines of the recent United Nations General Assembly. It is considered urgent by experts. The last three decades have been warmer than any other since 1850.
Climate disruptions worldwide, Cameroon included, clearly illustrate this. We have ourselves   taken measures to contribute to global efforts to reduce greenhouse gases. 
I should mention that the last G20 Summit also considered the issue and that, shortly before the summit, China and the United States of America had taken a more positive stance thereon than previously. Hence, the climate conference to be scheduled for 2015 in Paris will be held under the best conditions. It will seek to arrive at   a global, binding and equitable agreement. 
I believe equitable here means that such agreement would mainstream each country’s level of development and efforts made by some States to preserve their forests. Such is clearly the case of   countries of the Congo Basin which is home to the world’s second largest forest reserve after the Amazon, or one of the lungs of the world. 
The Paris Summit should also focus on the drying up of Lake Chad. As I suggested recently in Dakar, we believe that this Summit should work out a Lake Chad rescue plan.
If I were to summarize my ideas, I would say that the year that has just ended had its fair share of threats, but also reasons for hope. To cope with this situation, I believe that the international community should promote the values of modern society, namely solidarity and belief in progress.
In the moral sense of the word, solidarity is the obligation for wealthy nations to assist poor countries and forge equitable links with them. This is also what induces big powers and international organizations to intervene in conflict zones in order to end aggression or rescue populations.
Belief in progress is the determination of peoples to establish democracy, guarantee human rights, roll back poverty and provide access to education and health care for all.
That is why I believe that even though in some parts of the world oppression, misery and obscurantism persist, human society will ultimately triumph over tyranny and intolerance.
The hideous attack of 7 January 2015 against a newspaper in Paris shows how far fanaticism can go. I strongly condemn this awful act by supporters   of violence and terror. It is clear that under such circumstances, the only response is concrete mobilization and general determination to combat barbarism.
•The Dean of the Diplomatic Corps,
It is now time for me to thank you for the kind words you have spoken on behalf of Members of the Diplomatic Corps. As you prepare to leave Cameroon, I take this opportunity to commend your actions as Ambassador of your country and as Dean of the Diplomatic Corps. We wish you success in your new position.
•Members of the Diplomatic Corps,
Kindly extend our best wishes for the New Year to the Distinguished Authorities that you so worthily represent here.
To you, your families and your loved ones, I extend my most sincere wishes for happiness, health and success.
Thank you for your kind attention.

Heads of State, Government and Delegation,
The Secretary-General of the International Organization of La Francophonie,
Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,
 
We have long known that the world is unfair. We also know that overcoming poverty and exclusion will require much time and effort.
We equally know that the world is a dangerous place and that trouble can break out at any time in the form of civil or foreign war, ethnic or religious rivalry, oppression of the population by factions, you name it.
Faced with these challenges, one may wonder what more our Organization can do.
The answer will be that it is already greatly involved in the preservation of peace and the furtherance of democracy and human rights. Mention will also be made of its role in the defence of solidarity between nations and its support for education and training. That is true. And on that score, I wish to heartily congratulate my brother and friend, President Abdou DIOUF, for all the remarkable work he has done.
I simply wish to say that lately, we have been facing new challenges.
The first of these challenges concerns our security. Hitherto, we had to deal with local conflicts whose consequences rarely went beyond the sub-region. Today, we are threatened by a multifaceted global destabilization campaign. From the offensive in Iraq and Syria, it has spread its tentacles right to Mali and to the entire Sahel zone in recent years. It is also threatening the whole world through terrorism.
For instance, I would like to draw your attention to the situation in my country which is currently facing attacks from the Boko Haram sect. I will mention in passing that all of Nigeria’s immediate neighbours are OIF members and just like Cameroon, are concerned.
Faced with a common “enemy” who rebuffs every value we hold dear, solidarity must come fully into play. Recent history teaches us that there can be no compromise with such an opponent.
I need not say that we remain determined advocates of peace. We will not give up the “dialogue of cultures” so dear to President SENGHOR, champion of universal brotherhood.
Secondly, I believe that the spirit of solidarity existing between us must be kept up in the area of development. We are aware that the Millennium Development Goals scheduled to end next year will not be achieved. The Post-2015 Agenda will take over. Making up for lost time is an imperative. There is no other way to roll back poverty which is a breeding ground for extremism and revolt.
To that end, OIF’s new strategic framework will be a precious asset. By advocating for more active solidarity towards least developed countries, our Organization will contribute towards reducing inequalities between the North and the South. 
I would like to add that if women and youth, who make up three quarters of the population of most of our countries, have equal access to health, education and training as OIF is striving to ensure, we would have made great strides towards progress in our societies. Therefore, the theme chosen for our 15th Summit, namely “Women and Youth in La Francophonie: vectors of peace, actors of development” is apt. In this regard, we will focus on the aspirations of women and youth through concrete programmes and projects. By so doing, we will be providing women and youth with the wherewithal to combat poverty, hunger and disease. “This new frontier” is fully in line with our Organization’s humanist tradition.
Besides these fundamental tasks, many other issues require our in-put, not least among which is environmental protection.
 The countries of the Central African sub-region feel that by preserving the great Congo basin forest, they contribute significantly towards reducing greenhouse gases. Hence, they are pleased that the People's Republic of China and the United States of America seem to have embarked on that. This augurs well for next year’s Paris Conference on Climate. The situation of Lake Chad is another cause for concern to us. We are almost helplessly watching its tragic progressive disappearance. In addition, there are security and socio-political challenges. The Paris Conference should work towards establishing a Lake Chad rescue plan. It is a suggestion.
Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,  
I believe that our Organization has what it takes to be in the vanguard of the international community. To continue to be a veritable think tank, it should remain true to its values and be bold enough to adapt to an ever-changing world.
In these threat-filled times when barbarism is once again raising its ugly head, OIF must show that the destiny of humankind lies in a future of brotherhood and tolerance, and not one of hatred and violence.
I would now like to thank the Senegalese authorities and people for their warm welcome and brotherly hospitality on the occasion of the 15th Summit of the International Organization of La Francophonie.
Thank you for your attention.

•Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, 
First, I would like, on behalf of the Cameroonian people, to wish you a warm welcome to Cameroon, on African soil, and a pleasant stay in Yaounde. I salute in particular our good friends who have come here from afar and those who are setting foot on African soil for the first time. As you know, it is always a great pleasure to welcome friends from distant places.
• Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,
• Distinguished Participants, 
Your conference is taking place in an international context marked by the persistence of many hotbeds of tension. Several parts of the world continue to witness political, economic and social crises. Armed clashes abound. There are repeated and senseless terrorist attacks and acts of maritime piracy which challenge the international community.
This gloomy picture has been compounded by the outbreak of the Ebola viral epidemic. Within months, it has already claimed thousands of lives in Africa. The virus poses a real threat that transcends State boundaries, while the international community is yet to find an appropriate response to contain it.
Therefore, we should hail this conference which is opening today despite the hostile international context. Your presence affirms and confirms your determination to address the challenges of this century.
My country is delighted to have been chosen to host the 60th Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference. The people of Cameroon are honoured by this mark of esteem and confidence. 
The massive turnout of Commonwealth Members of Parliament is an eloquent testimony to their interest in fostering solidarity among the peoples they represent.  For the great Commonwealth family, it is also an excellent example of its deep commitment to working relentlessly and resolutely for a better world. This is truly a source of satisfaction, but also and above all, of hope. 
•Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, 
•Distinguished Participants, 
The theme of your discussions at the Yaounde Conference is “Repositioning the Commonwealth for the Post-2015 Development Agenda”.
Besides being fully in line with the very foundations of our organization, this theme is highly topical. 
In fact, social progress and human development issues are prime concerns of the Community of Nations. They are interwoven with those of peace and security, as there can be no development without minimum security and stability.
The 69th Session of the United Nations General Assembly which has just opened in New York is working on the framework and content of the world’s Post-2015 Development Agenda.
As you are aware, the adoption of the Declaration on the Millennium Development Goals on 8 September 2000 raised new hopes for a world where peace, security and prosperity would be shared at last. 
Fifteen years following the adoption of these goals, it must be acknowledged, unfortunately, that they will not be achieved by 2015 as agreed.
Certainly, significant progress has been made in some areas such as education, immunization coverage, the fight against HIV and malaria, and gender promotion in school. This is commendable.
    Theseappreciable efforts notwithstanding, it should be admitted that much remains to be done in key areas. Hunger has not been eradicated, poverty reduction is extremely slow, unemployment, especially among the youth, remains a thorny problem and health coverage remains inadequate. 
The international community must learn lessons from the difficulties faced over the last fifteen years.  
The Post-2015 Agenda shoulddevise new strategies to substantially improve the population’s living conditions.  
All players will need to demonstrate a stronger political will, greater generosity and more effective, more concrete and more active solidarity. Such are the demands of the interdependence of States and unity of humanity on us. Without this extra touch of the soul, development by the end of the new Agenda may remain a distant goal. 
•Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,
The UN’s adoption of a Post-2015 Development Agenda reflects reckoning with past lapses as well as recognition of the need for immediate action, with greater determination and greater commitment in order to secure the future.
To that end, African countries have prepared a common position which proposes the alignment of the Agenda with national and international development programmes, fully consistent with the African Union’s 2063 Agenda. This common position also comprises new cooperation thrusts aimed at eradicating poverty, creating endogenous conditions for economic transformation, preserving peace and progressing towards prosperity and sustainable development. 
•DistinguishedCommonwealth Parliamentarians,
The challenges I have just outlined are not peculiar to Africa. They are common to all peoples of the world of whom many of you are the elected representatives.
It behoves you to plead with national and international authorities to honour their commitments. It is your bounden duty to work towards giving such commitments force of law in your respective countries. 
While hoping that the Yaounde Conference will be a confirmation of your commitment to shared development in the world, and wishing you every success in your proceedings, I declare open the 60th Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference.
Long live the Commonwealth and Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II!
Long live Cameroon!
Thank you.

Permit me first of all to welcome you to the Palace of the Republic.
Today is a day of joy, joy equalled only by the anguish and anxiety which gripped us throughout your detention.
The Ambassador of the People's Republic of China,
It is with pleasure and joy that I hand over to you your compatriots who were detained under awful conditions. I would like to say that they were able to survive thanks to their courage, their will and their determination. I congratulate them for that and wish them good luck for the future. I wish them a safe return to your great country. 
My dear compatriots,
I cannot hide the joy we feel to see you back safe and sound. Mrs ALI, the Lamido of Kolofata and their entire families are back among us. You demonstrated courage, endurance and faith in God. That is what saved you. 
All this, all what is happening and which brings us great joy, we should bear in mind, is thanks to the bravery of our armed forces. Our army is fighting courageously day and night to ensure that Cameroon remains a country of peace and stability. 
We also owe this good result to the commitment of the Cameroonian people, be they in the North, the South, the East or the West, and especially the people of the Far North who are going through the ordeal everyday but still provide commendable support to the forces of law and order. 
It is all this that has enabled us to see you again. We cannot hide our joy. We wish you a happy return to your families and to your countries. 
For its part, the Government of Cameroon assures you that it will not relent in its fight against Boko Haram until it is completely wiped out.
I wish you good luck and a safe return to your families.

Paul BIYA, President of the Republic of Cameroon, at the official luncheon offered on September 16, 2014 at Unity Palace in honour of Madam Irina BOKOVA, Director General of UNESCO.
Madam Director-General of UNESCO, 
Permit me to tell you how delighted my wife and I are to welcome you on the occasion of your visit to Cameroon.
I need not remind you that you are very much at home in Cameroon. By some happy coincidence, you bear the same name as a well-known locality in the south-west of Cameroon. By the way, you are an illustrious dignitary of Bokova. The custodians of tradition have granted you the attributes of that status. 
This once again shows how pleased we are to welcome you here today, Madam Director-General.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
As you are aware, our relationship with UNESCO is longstanding, coming on the heels of our accession to international sovereignty over half a century ago. Our belonging to this body was driven by our desire to draw closer to all peoples of the world. As a protector and promoter of the equality of cultures, UNESCO was the most appropriate interlocutor. 
We stand proud of the ground covered together. To refresh your memory, I would like to recall the leading role played by your Organization in the creation, running and functioning of the Yaounde Higher Teachers Training College (ENS) which recently commemorated its 50th anniversary. 
Your support in the preservation, promotion, expression and influence of our culture is equally immeasurable. We proudly remember the brochure containing the findings of the survey conducted under your supervision on all the dances of Cameroon. We do remember your assistance in preparations for Cameroon’s participation at the first-ever Festival of Negro Arts in Dakar and the first Pan-African Cultural Festival in Algiers. 
Lastly, I would like to mention UNESCO’s contribution towards restoring historical monuments such as the Foumban Palace and preserving our wildlife, especially the Dja Reserve which features on your Organization’s list of World Natural and Cultural Heritage since 1987. 
Madam Director-General,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
With increasing ideological conflicts and trouble spots, UNESCO’s role in the quest for peace, highly commendable as it is, needs to be stepped up. For, we must bear in mind that victory through the force of arms cannot alone ensure peace, that is, lasting peace. 
Lasting peace cannot be imposed, it is built and lived daily by mutual acceptance and tolerance which lead to and promote dialogue. All these virtues indeed constitute the raison d’être of UNESCO.  
The Preamble of UNESCO’s constitution clearly states and I quote: “Since wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the minds of men that the defences of peace must be constructed”. Unquote.
Madam Director-General,
The preservation of peace also entails the fight against inequality and poverty.
You know this very well because in 2009 you placed your first tenure under the banner of promoting a “new humanism”; humanism based on solidarity and focused on the full development of the individual and all mankind. 
You gave priority to the development programmes of African countries. The geographical and operational reorganization of UNESCO’s services is also credited to you. By establishing five Regional Offices in Africa, you have brought your Organization closer to the people, making them more aware of UNESCO’s work.
Cameroon highly appreciates your support in your various areas of competence and we are sure that your visit will further enhance our multidimensional cooperation.
In this regard, I wish to commend the opening in Cameroon of a major UNESCO office for Central Africa. Pursuant to my instructions, the Government has taken all necessary measures to facilitate its establishment and ensure its proper functioning. 
Madam Director-General,
Allow me to conclude where I should have started. I wish to heartily congratulate you on your re-election at the helm of UNESCO. I wish to commend the mastery and skill with which you devote yourself to the service of humanity. 
Ladies and Gentlemen,
My wife and I now invite you to raise your glasses in honour of Madam Irina BOKOVA, Director-General of UNESCO, to the success of her mission at the service of peace and to the sustainability of Cameroon-UNESCO relations.
Thank you.",https://prc.cm/en/news/speeches-of-the-president/821-cameroon-united-states-economic-forum

•Cameroon’s Ambassador to Washington,
•The Chair of the Corporate Council on Africa (CCA),

•Distinguished Public and Private Business Leaders,
•Ladies and Gentlemen,
First and foremost, I would like to thank President Obama for initiating this US-Africa Summit, the very first in the history of our relations.
It is within this context and as a prelude to the Summit that this maiden  Cameroon/USA Economic Forum is taking place.
My country feels honoured by it. 
I heartily thank the Chair of the Corporate Council on Africa and all its members for participating in the preparation and organization of this gathering.
By choosing to bring together American investors and representatives of Cameroon’s private sector and members of Government, the CCA made a bet based on trust. And rightly so.
Cameroon is here to invite you to participate in the development of its potential. In many respects, my country is indeed a land of opportunity. During the forum, the Cameroonian delegation, which includes Government ministers, private sector representatives and U.S. investors already operating in Cameroon, will present the said opportunities to you in detail. 
In a word, note that:
-Cameroon is a stable country which enjoys a peaceful democracy;
-Its growth rate is rising: it currently stands at 5.5% in 2014, up from 4.6% in 2013;
-Major infrastructure projects are underway in sectors such as energy, ports, roads, agro-industry, mining, etc.;
-We have huge potential in the areas of energy, agriculture, forestry and mining;
-Our tourist industry is worth developing.
Investment opportunities abound in Cameroon. Incentives meeting international standards have been put in place.
Our business environment is the focus of an ongoing public-private dialogue. In short, investing in Cameroon is a good risk.
NOW IS THE TIME TO INVEST IN CAMEROON:
-through joint ventures, or
-by setting up your businesses in developed and serviced economic zones. 
Therein, you will enjoy accompanying measures.
I hope that in the course of this forum, will make useful contacts for fruitful discussions that will lead to mutually beneficial projects. 
I wish you every success in your deliberations. Thank you for your attention.-

•Members of the Pan-African Lawyers Union Executive Committee,
•President THABO MBEKI and dear brother,
•Excellencies,
•Ladies and Gentlemen,
I am particularly pleased to take the floor on this solemn ceremony of the award of your organization’s “Peaceful Conflict Resolution” Prize.
On this occasion, I wish to heartily thank you for choosing Cameroon to host the Triennial Assembly of the Pan-African Lawyers Union.
Permit me also to acknowledge the presence in our midst of Mr THABO MBEKI, our brother, former President of the Republic of South Africa, whom I would like to welcome.
•Excellencies,
•Ladies and Gentlemen,
In the world today, many armed conflicts undermine the stability of States or peace among nations. Unfortunately, Africa illustrates this fact, as epitomized by the tragic situation presently faced by the Central African Republic.
The causes of conflict in Africa are many and varied. It would be tedious to review them. I would limit myself to pointing out the threat posed to peace by border and land disputes.
For example, I would like to dwell briefly on the efforts made by Nigeria and Cameroon to find a peaceful solution to the land dispute over the Bakassi Peninsula.
I dare say that on both sides, all the resources of diplomacy and international justice were used and that such efforts helped to bring about an honourable outcome for both parties. 
It was thus demonstrated that the use of force poses more problems than it resolves. This fact is stipulated in the United Nations Charter which prohibits the use of force and calls for the peaceful resolution of disputes.
It is therefore possible to achieve peace on the basis of law; provided, however, that force gives way to law; provided also that States recognize the supremacy of international law and the pre-eminent role of the United Nations.
Moreover, world peace can only be assured if the International Community upholds solidarity as one of the fundamental values in relations between nations. We can only rejoice in the ever-growing awareness of this obligation by a majority of States.
In this respect also, the role of the United Nations is crucial.
On the other hand, conflicts, whether internal or between State entities, affect the economic take-off of African States and their development in general. In this regard, I am pleased to congratulate the Pan-African Lawyers Union for its outstanding work by proposing solutions to our States with within the scope of its missions.
Until international law finally prevails over the use of force, I remain convinced that it should be guided by law, notably in the case of self-defence.
It is in this spirit that we have taken measures to defend ourselves against the terrorist actions of Boko Haram in Nigeria.
At this juncture, I would like to underscore the relevance of the theme of your General Assembly, namely “Illicit Financial Flows from Africa”. In fact, it has been established that the resources derived from organized crime are used to finance terrorism and arms trafficking.
•The President of the Pan-African Lawyers Union,
•Excellencies,
•Ladies and Gentlemen,
A prestigious award like the one dedicated to the peaceful resolution of conflicts fills the person receiving it with a feeling of joy and pride.
Permit me to share the honour bestowed on me with all those who worked for the peaceful settlement of the border dispute between Nigeria and Cameroon.
I am thinking particularly of:
-the International Court of Justice;
-my brother, President OLUSEGUN OBASANJO and the former Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr KOFI ANNAN;
-my successive Nigerian counterparts;
-witness States, namely Germany, the United States of America, France and the United Kingdom; as well as
-the current Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr BAN KI MOON.
Lastly, permit me to express my profound gratitude to you for the prize that your Organization, in agreement with the African Union, has kindly awarded me.
To conclude, I cannot say it any better than quoting an extract from the UNESCO Constitution, I quote: “Since wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the minds of men that the defences of peace must be constructed”. 
This is a programme, an entire programme, which is more topical than ever. A great programme that is a challenge to all of us.
Thank you.

HEAD OF STATE’S MESSAGE TO THE YOUTH ON THE OCCASION OF THE 48TH EDITION OF THE NATIONAL YOUTH DAY
My dear young compatriots, 
Last year, under the same circumstances, I told you that I was aware of your doubts and worries about an uncertain future. But I added that we had reason to hope and that, to me, the country’s prospects seemed brighter.
Recent trends in employment statistics seem to bear me out.
The 2013 forecasts for new jobs stood at 200 000. The number of jobs actually created was about 12% higher, reaching nearly 225 000. Private enterprises in various sectors, alone, provided 165 000 jobs. For its part, the Administration, through its different branches, provided 60 000 jobs.
Higher targets have been set for 2014. With the possible increase in the country’s growth rate, we hope to create more than 250 000 new jobs. Of course, this will not benefit only the youth. However, one can surmise that they will be the main beneficiaries.
This vision stems from a logical analysis of the situation of our economy which is expected to grow by about 5% in the coming months. In this regard, I expressed my view a few weeks ago. I still believe that we can do better. I am strongly convinced that we will.
My dear young compatriots,
In this race for growth which, in 20 years, should set our country on the path to economic emergence, you have a vital role, a crucial role to play. 
In the coming years, who will build our:
-major energy, agricultural and industrial projects; 
-road, port and aviation infrastructure;  
-water supply and electricity distribution works; 
-thousands of low-cost houses; 
-hospitals and health centres; 
-primary and secondary schools and universities? 
You, of course, my dear compatriots.
Therefore, you should right now start preparing yourselves seriously for this task, whether in primary school, secondary school or university. We need and will need thousands of skilled workers, qualified technicians, excellent engineers, competent accountants and salespersons, and so on. Our educational system at its different levels had already opted for professionalization. We will soon witness its impact, which you will find remarkable.
Those who have already entered the work force and who are practising the trades learned “on the job” will need more training opportunities. As we expect a revival of our economy, we should be capable of meeting the demand for many specialists in various trades. We can no longer be content with supplying mere labourers, leaving the best jobs to others. Such better-trained professionals will join the ranks of craftsmen who are in high demand.
Last year, using the example of motorcycle taxi riders who play an obvious social role, I underscored the need to organize this profession. I am pleased to note that government services, following consultations with stakeholders, have developed a collective mentoring programme. By so doing, motorcycle taxi riders will be able to participate more - and better - in our national development projects.
This programme involves various aspects of this profession, notably training, management and organization. Perhaps this experiment can be replicated in other informal sector activities.
My dear young compatriots,
I equally expressed my concern about the decline in public morality in our country. I deplored the fact that the youth, who are our most valuable asset, our future and the future of our country, have not been spared. I commend Government’s prompt response to this alert through the holding of an international conference on the theme in Yaounde. Its ambitious objective is to “make Cameroon an exemplary country. This objective concerns us all to the utmost level: parents, teachers, religious authorities.
Respect for public morality also means commitment to national integration which is the cement of our Nation. Furthermore, it means attachment to the rules of democracy, a model that we have chosen in order to build a just and cohesive society. This affords me the opportunity to hail the high turnout of the youth in the election of 30 September and the election of some of their peers into the National Assembly and council executives.
I also wish to express my satisfaction with the refocusing of the activities of the National Civic Service for Participation in Development Agency. The new leadership in place should improve the mentoring of the first 6 000 volunteers trained. In this regard, I also wish to recall that in 2013, the Rural and Urban Youth Support Programme with its Youth Socio-economic Integration Project through the Manufacture of Sports Equipment, contributed, through its supervision, to creating 1 000 jobs. These came to add to the 225 000 that I mentioned earlier on.
Regarding the general youth policy, I would like to welcome the election of new executives of the National Youth Council at both the national and local levels. Through these elections, which were conducted satisfactorily, the Cameroonian youth showed that they are part and parcel of our lofty vision which is to make Cameroon an emerging country by 2035. In this respect, the Government has established more than 400 multi-purpose youth promotion centres in subdivisions and divisions. Such mobilization will continue in the months ahead.
My dear young compatriots,
As you can see, things are happening in Cameroon. The momentum is building and it is irreversible. You will be its main actors.
Before concluding, I would like all of us to go fifty to sixty years down memory lane. This is History, you may say. Yes, but perhaps we have not learned all the lessons from it.
During that period of turmoil, those who dreamed of independence and national unity were young people like you. They differed in many respects: ideology, party, strategy and tactics. But the goal was clear: FREEDOM. And many engaged in this struggle putting their lives on the line.
Today, the stakes are different. Although the commitment I expect from you does not require you to make the ultimate sacrifice, it is nonetheless crucial. It is about enabling our country to reach a level of development such that every Cameroonian can: live decently on his work, raise his children properly, and have decent housing and protection from disease.
My young compatriots, such is the task before you.
When, in a few weeks, we celebrate the Fiftieth Anniversary of Reunification which complements our Independence, I urge you to spare a thought for those who sacrificed their lives for you to be able to live in a society of freedom and progress.
Happy Youth Day to you all.
Long live Cameroonian youth!
Long live Cameroon!

https://prc.cm/en/news/speeches-of-the-president/538-speech-by-the-head-of-state-in-response-to-new-year-wishes-from-the-diplomatic-corps,/en/news/speeches-of-the-president/538-speech-by-the-head-of-state-in-response-to-new-year-wishes-from-the-diplomatic-corps,"•The Dean of the Diplomatic Corps,
•Ambassadors and High Commissioners,
•Representatives of International Organizations,
Though the crippling effects of the economic and financial crisis are fading, who would dare say that it is definitely behind us? 
With a few exceptions, industrialized countries are still in recession or struggling to return to growth. Austerity policies based on public spending cuts and tax hikes are the order of the day. In many cases, the social fabric remains plagued by unemployment.
Emerging countries have not been spared by this downturn. They bear the brunt by opting for an inward-looking policy.
Developing countries are relatively less affected due to their limited integration into the global economy. They are striving to stimulate   growth and emerge from being merely suppliers of raw materials by developing and diversifying their industrial sector.
Everyone has a vague feeling that the causes of the crisis have not truly been addressed. Therefore, a relapse is not to be ruled out.
For the time being, public opinion is content with this lull. In contrast, confidence which is indispensable for economic progress is yet to be restored. The major powers are giving no assurance of having adequately addressed the failings of the global economy, or of having understood the need for regulation. However, with the agreement reached by the WTO following years of negotiation, there is every   reason to hope for the facilitation of trade, agriculture and development.
Under these circumstances of uncertainty though, it is not surprising that each State or group of States which is fortunate to have been spared by bankruptcy or recession should prefer to address the most urgent needs in a bid to restore equilibrium and growth. It seems such a long time ago since globalization heralded harmonious economic and financial development worldwide! Indeed, it has been a long time since solidarity ceased being the watchword in relations between industrialized and developing countries.
Is this a reason to lose all hope of restoring relations between rich and poor countries based on the principles of human solidarity? I do not believe so. I think that it will be possible to resume discussions on these issues once the turbulence of the crisis subsides. An example of this assertion is the debate that took place during the last United Nations General Assembly on development after 2015, the target year of the Millennium Development Goals.
It is heartening to note that despite the current difficulties, the international community has not lost sight of issues related to the conditions of living of the majority of people.
Unfortunately, human beings have their share of responsibility for the problems plaguing them, as evidenced by the tragic events rocking some regions of the planet.
I will begin with Syria which for so many months has been torn by a bloody civil war claiming countless victims. Mediation has failed. Negotiations between major powers at the Security Council have ended in stalemate. The agreement on the destruction of Syria’s chemical weapons is yet to pave the way for a genuine settlement. The situation is deadlocked. In addition, the conflict, which is causing hundreds of thousands of refugees to stream into Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey, could destabilize these countries and the region.
The situation in Iraq is far from stable. Recurrent attacks have already claimed thousands of victims. All efforts should be made to prevent Afghanistan from drifting along the same path when American troops withdraw.
The election of a new leadership in Iran has raised hopes for the normalization of relations between the country and the international community. Can one anticipate a lasting solution to negotiations on the nuclear capability of this great country?
The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has lasted several decades. There seems to be hope for a two-State solution based on the mutual recognition of each other’s right to exist. However, it is difficult to predict the outcome of the never-ending negotiations between the two parties under the auspices of the major powers.
Of course, they intervene in these conflicts either bilaterally or within the framework of the United Nations, particularly the Security Council. Insofar as they have strategic national interests, it is inevitable for them to oppose each other when such interests are at stake. Yet, it is necessary for them to consider the concerns of the populations affected and their accession to the United Nations Charter when defining their positions. By so doing, they would earn more esteem and enhance the credibility of the Security Council.
The situation in Africa is hardly more encouraging. In North Africa where the “Arab Spring” raised great expectations, restoring equilibrium is proving difficult. In Tunisia, Egypt and Libya in particular, transition to democratic forms of government remains challenging. It is hoped that these countries with early and brilliant civilizations will, through dialogue, restore harmony among the different components of their populations.
Closer to us geographically, our brothers in Mali had to deal with aggression by armed factions jeopardizing their territorial integrity and the foundations of their society. The situation was brought under control thanks to the intervention of France and Chad, with the support of ECOWAS and the African Union. However, the threat remains, as evidenced by several incidents in the Kidal region.
In fact, the threat extends far beyond the Sahel region, as seen in Northern Nigeria, CAR and even as far as Somalia and Kenya. Cameroon is not spared either, as attested by the hostage taking incidents witnessed lately in the Far-North Region of the country. Of course, we have always used all available means to ensure their release. Fortunately, we have succeeded. Once more, we would like to thank the French and Nigerian authorities for supporting our services.
In recent years, the African Union has examined security issues and developed a “peace and security architecture”. The events in Mali highlighted some gaps in the responsiveness of this mechanism. It will be necessary to pursue the review of this issue which we started last May. In fact, we have established the African Capacity for Immediate Response to Crises (ACIRC). It is a new and, therefore, more effective rapid response mechanism.
The painful events that CAR has been experiencing for some time now have raised awareness that Africa should find the means to ensure its own security. France, through a United Nations mandate, intervened urgently to stop acts of brutality and strengthen MISCA which includes a Cameroonian contingent.
Faced with the worsening situation, we had to repatriate about four thousand of our compatriots. We want to salute the work of MISCA and Operation SANGARIS in protecting civilians and disarming the groups involved.
Each passing day reveals to us the complexity of the situation and the numerous humanitarian, security, law enforcement and administrative challenges to deal with. Hence, the pressing need for a holistic approach. Only a United Nations peacekeeping operation would effectively address such challenges. That is why this seems to be the right time to speed up preparations to transform MISCA into a peacekeeping operation, in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 2127.
At this juncture, I would like to mention the Paris Summit on Peace and Security in Africa in which I participated. The overall security issues on the continent were discussed. I think the involvement of European powers - and especially France –, the United Nations and the international community is an expression of greater solidarity with Africa, and should thus be welcomed.
But terrorism is not limited to the continent. For some time now, it has reached the oceans, particularly the Gulf of Guinea. Countless ships have been boarded or crews kidnapped in this area. 
To address this situation, an ECOWAS and ECCAS Heads of State Summit on Maritime Safety and Security in the Gulf of Guinea was held in Yaounde on 24 and 25 June 2013. The summit appears to have met expectations. The Final Declaration provides for the establishment of an intercommunity framework for cooperation on maritime security. A code of conduct for the prevention and repression of acts of piracy was also adopted. Lastly, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed, providing for the setting up, in Cameroon, of an Inter-regional Centre for the coordination of measures taken by States. 
Our diplomacy, which is mainly focused on affairs concerning our continent, also played its rightful role at the multilateral level, notably at the United Nations, but also at the continental, regional and bilateral levels.
In this regard, it should be noted that I paid an official visit to Paris at the beginning of the year to establish contact with the new French authorities. I also paid a state visit to Turkey in March. With the latter, which is becoming a major power, we signed various cooperation agreements which augur well for the development of our ties.
I also visited the Holy See at the invitation of His Holiness Pope Francis. During our discussions, I noted a broad convergence of views on topical international issues. Similarly, His Holiness and I share the feeling that in attempting to settle disputes and deal with migration issues, the international community should accord greater importance to human solidarity.
I also wish to recall that the process initiated by the Greentree Agreement came to an end in August. Our country has thus recovered its full sovereignty over the Bakassi area. The settlement of this case paved the way for strengthening friendly ties between Nigeria and Cameroon. It will remain, I believe, an example of dispute resolution in accordance with international law.
We also received in Yaounde special envoys from friendly countries, notably the United States, the Federal Republic of Germany and Turkey - already mentioned - , eager to learn about our positions and to explore ways of boosting our trade. I also had the opportunity to meet with leaders of major international industrial groups willing to invest in our country.
I cannot conclude this overview before you who are informed and objective observers of the Cameroonian political scene without mentioning the various elections held in Cameroon in 2013. 
First, I would like to tell you that everything possible, everything necessary was done to make them free and fair. If there were some failings, responsibility for them is attributable not to the government but to inexperience or inevitable human error. In any case, they did not affect the results. Besides, there were very few disputes which after examination, generally proved groundless.
I am very keen on setting the record straight, because it is very important for my country and for me personally, that our commitment to building a democratic Cameroon should not be called into question. Although, by definition, elections are an internal affair, the prominent representatives of the international community that you are, will appreciate, I hope, our determination to stay on that course.
However, democracy, lest it be perfunctory, must be accompanied by economic and social progress. This forms the very foundation of our vision of society. To achieve this, we rely primarily on our own strength, but also on cooperation with the partners you represent. I want to thank them for their great contribution to our development efforts. I would like to reaffirm that Cameroon will always welcome foreign investors, be they public or private. We will offer them win-win partnerships.
Before concluding, I would like to pay tribute to Nelson Mandela who passed away recently. He, who was the African conscience, is irreplaceable and will remain in our minds and hearts, and continue to illuminate our path to freedom and to embody the dignity of Africans.
•Distinguished Members of the Diplomatic Corps, 
It is now time for me to thank your Dean for the kind wishes he has extended to me on your behalf and for his encouragement which I appreciate. I would also like to thank him for his thoughtful and kind appreciation of my wife’s humanitarian activities.
In return, I would be much obliged if you would convey my own wishes to the distinguished authorities that you represent.
I also extend to you, your families and your loved ones, my most sincere wishes for happiness, health and success.
Thank you for your kind attention.

https://prc.cm/en/news/speeches-of-the-president/525-address-by-the-head-of-state-to-the-nation-on-the-occasion-of-the-end-of-year-2013-and-new-year-2014,/en/news/speeches-of-the-president/525-address-by-the-head-of-state-to-the-nation-on-the-occasion-of-the-end-of-year-2013-and-new-year-2014,"My dear compatriots,
The year 2013 gave Cameroonians genuine reasons to feel satisfied, thus paving the way for excellent prospects for the future. 
Let me explain.
The senatorial elections of 14 April and the legislative and municipal elections of 30 September took place in a calm and transparent atmosphere. All observers confirmed this fact and I believe that it reflects the maturity of the Cameroonian people who have understood that achieving social progress requires stable institutions and sound policies. The few failings reported were not enough to challenge the validity of the said elections. In this regard, ELECAM deserves to be commended. The enhanced credibility of the legislative and municipal elections sufficiently justified the time it took to introduce biometrics into our electoral system.
I therefore believe that there is every reason for us to be satisfied with this new milestone in our democratic process. The marked increase in the number of women in Parliament and municipal councils is a further sign of progress.
In any case, having put in place the Senate and local and regional authorities, the establishment of the Constitutional Council within a reasonable timeline will complete the institutional structure enshrined in our Constitution.
Our political horizon is now very clear. It is time for serious and objective discussions on issues that are dear to Cameroonians which, as you know, are purchasing power, employment and living conditions. In other words, such issues constitute what our people legitimately expect from a prosperous and equitable economy and a just and interdependent society.
Of course, this is no revelation to us. In recent decades, we have spared no effort to improve the living conditions of Cameroonians. This has been achieved despite the often tense political context, the economic crisis and threats to peace. Significant progress - perhaps still unevenly shared – has been made.
Let me mention just two examples, namely health and our major projects.
With the resurgence of malaria in its most severe form which affects infants, we have approached international partners for assistance. With their help, we will be able to secure free treatment of this pandemic for under-five children. Furthermore, I am pleased to announce that our country’s health map will soon have three additional referral hospitals, namely the Yaounde National Emergency Centre, the Douala Gynaecological, Obstetric and Paediatric Hospital and the Sangmelima Referral Hospital.
Regarding our major projects, those of the first generation are, as you know, either ongoing or in the start-up phase.
Concerning second-generation projects which will be implemented as from 2015, the related studies and financing are currently under negotiation. These include notably power generation, transportation, water supply, road and highway infrastructure as well as industrial and mining facilities.
As you can see, our economy is picking up and some kind of national consensus on the goal of economic emergence is discernible. I believe that we should muster all our energy to champion this cause and summon all our strength to ensure growth. In fact, it seems that our efforts alone, no matter how laudable, will not suffice to make Cameroon an emerging country in 2035.
International financial institutions have sounded this friendly warning to us; and it is in our interest to heed it. In 2013, our growth rate stands at 4.8%, and thus below our forecast of 6.1%. Of course, there is nothing so dramatic about this, yet it clearly indicates that we need to redouble our efforts.
Our growth is currently sustained by buoyant oil revenues and public appropriations. Private investments remain inadequate. We still need to improve the business climate, but this certainly does not spare us from pursuing ongoing structural reforms and further strengthening fiscal discipline.
Definitely, there is still room for improvement in the effectiveness of our economic policies. We have a growth and employment strategy which guides us towards achieving our goals. But, how come then that in some sectors of our economy, State action often seems to lack consistency and clarity? Why is it that in many cases, decision-making delays still constitute a bottleneck in project implementation? Why can’t any region of our country achieve a public investment budget execution rate of over 50%? Lastly, one can rightfully question the usefulness of certain project monitoring committees which are unable to take any decisions.
What we need in the coming years is a real contingency plan. With the GESP, we have a trend chart. Now is the time to act.
Our short-term priorities are well known, namely:  to correct our growth curve by creating jobs and maintain a high level of performance over several years in a row. To this end, we need to set timelines on our roadmaps and strictly adhere to them.
It will be absolutely imperative that we address the causes of our weaknesses by removing sticking points,     areas of dispersion and duplication.
Would we be unable to do what some other countries comparable to ours have done or are doing? I do not think so. We have talented, resourceful, well-trained and enterprising men, women and youth, who are capable of meeting these challenges. We have abundant and diverse natural resources as well as modern and democratic institutions. Our country is peaceful and stable. What then do we lack?
I think we need to improve in two key areas: prioritizing general interest and coordinating our efforts.
Though attached to our communities of origin - which does not prevent us from being fervent patriots whenever national honour is at stake - we are an individualistic people, more concerned with personal success than general interest. Our administration remains susceptible to private interest, which is most often in conflict with national interest. Such trends must not be tolerated in a modern state.  
At one stage of implementation or another, most of our major projects involve the skills of various services. I am not sure that there has been effective coordination between them. Clearly, therefore, there is a need for improvement in this regard.
My dear compatriots,
I would now like to draw your attention to a problem that has reached disturbing proportions in recent months – that of insecurity in our country.
Not long ago, we were striving to overcome “ordinary” insecurity. Simply put, we fought minor and organized crime in urban areas and “highway robbers” in remote rural areas. 
For some time now, a new form of crime referred to as cross-border crime has reached a worrying scale, particularly in the northern and eastern parts of the country.
This has been brought about by the presence around our borders of armed bands, driven by extremist ideologies and lured by profit. They do not hesitate to cross over to our territory where they commit various atrocities. This phenomenon is not entirely new. However, it has witnessed a fresh upsurge as not long ago there was an attack in Kette Subdivision in the eastern part of our country. Elite units have been deployed to the area to check such incursions. 
Over the months, in the Far North, such criminals have kidnapped foreign nationals for ransom. Memories of the abduction of the French family MOULIN-FOURNIER are still fresh. Thanks to our cooperation with the Nigerian authorities and French services, we were able to secure their release. More recently, a French priest was manhandled and taken to Nigeria. I strongly condemn such unspeakable acts perpetrated in the quest for gain against defenceless persons, including children. 
Of course, we are doing our best to prevent and combat such acts, and we will not relent. 
I congratulate the élite units ensuring security in these areas and urge the local population to cooperate with them as necessary.
For some time now, terrorism has also become rife at sea. Its motivations are mainly financial, but the methods have not changed. They consist in inspecting ships to loot the contents and kidnapping crew members for ransom. Cameroon has witnessed this in its maritime space.
The phenomenon has expanded to the entire Gulf of Guinea, such that the maritime trade of countries located in this area is being compromised. There was a first response at the Summit on Maritime Security and Safety in the Gulf of Guinea, held in Yaounde last 25 and 26 June.
It is clear that, whether on land or at sea, security, which is first and foremost a national issue, also has a collective and even international dimension. It should not be underestimated. Where it is not guaranteed, anarchy settles in, abuses become rife, economic and social progress grinds to a halt. Examples of such forms of breakdown in societal values, unfortunately, abound in our continent and even in our immediate external vicinity.
While it is true that the affected areas of our territory are very limited, we remain on the alert. Our security forces on the ground can intervene at any time. This is an opportunity for me to stress that each one of us must be aware of the benefits of living in a stable country where institutions are functioning normally, where the security of people and property is guaranteed, and where every citizen can nurse hopes of a better life.
The current situation in the Central African Republic demonstrates the possible consequences of instability and disorder. Massacre, looting and displacement have become the order of the day in that brotherly and friendly country. It was the duty of, and an honour for, Cameroonian troops to participate in the operations of the multinational force aimed at restoring security and protecting people within the territory of our immediate neighbour.
My dear compatriots,
We are somewhat at a crossroads. Growth is within our reach; our budget is viable; our public debt is sustainable; in short, our economic and financial situation gives us every reason to hope for prosperity.
-It is either we take the easy road by postponing reforms, in which case in 10 or 20 years time we shall have had such a cumulative delay that we can hardly meet the needs of our people.
-Or we set high goals for ourselves, and adopt strict collective discipline, in which case we will embark resolutely on economic emergence.
I suggest that we adopt the latter option, that of sacrifice and courage.
At a time when we are beginning to see many concrete signs of our democratic, economic and social progress, I invite you to embrace a new spirit of patriotism. I believe we can do a lot better.
I am not asking for your sweat, or blood, or tears; rather, I am merely urging you to commit yourself wholeheartedly to this new phase of our Grand National plan.
At the dawn of this New Year, I would like, on behalf of you all, to address our Indomitable Lions.
Dear Indomitable Lions, 
You have qualified for the final phase of the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. We want you to follow in the footsteps of your illustrious predecessors of the glorious campaigns in Spain in 1982 and Italy in 1990. Give us a thrill once again. The Cameroonian people are with you.
To conclude, I am pleased to announce the release of Father Georges Vandenbeusch. 
Thanks to the action of our services, backed by Nigerian and French authorities, this priest, so devoted to his mission, has been freed today.
My dear compatriots,
I would now like to extend to you all, my best wishes for good health and happiness in the New Year.
Happy and Prosperous New Year 2014!

Nelson Mandela’s death is a great loss to Africa and the world.
His life and work will forever be a source of inspiration for future generations.
On behalf of the Cameroonian People and on my personal behalf, I extend my heart-felt condolences to the family of the deceased, to President Zuma and to the entire People of South Africa.
The President of the French Republic,
Excellencies Heads of State, Government and Delegation,
The Secretary-General of the United Nations Organization,
The current Chair of the African Union,
The President of the European Council,
The President of the European Commission,
The Chair of the African Union Commission, 
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Taking the floor at this stage of our proceedings, I feel that my speech is coming too late, when all has been said and very well said. And so, my address will basically be to express gratitude and satisfaction.
Let me congratulate and thank you Mr President of the French Republic for the laudable initiative of this Summit on Peace and Security in Africa.
You were right to complement the general theme with a reflection on Economic Partnership and Development. In fact, since 1967, when Pope Paul VI published the Encyclical “Populorum Progressio”, “Peoples’ Development”, it is accepted that Development is the new name for Peace.
The theme of our discussions is “Peace, Security and Development in Africa”.  It is an important theme because it forms an entire agenda by itself. An agenda which is of interest to us all, urging us to act in a joint and concerted manner in the mutual interest of Africa and Europe within the framework a win-win partnership.
I would also like to express my gratitude and satisfaction for this new opportunity given us to highlight the threats to Peace posed by poaching, all forms of trafficking, hostage-taking, piracy and climate change. Poverty is another threat to Peace. And the UN Security Council was right to make the fight against poverty a crucial element of Peace building.
To overcome these threats and ensure Peace itself, we need to pool our efforts, energies and resources in order to act as partners.
Lastly, permit me to express our appreciation of the excellent preparation of our proceedings.
The Final Declaration is a perfect illustration of this. In our opinion, it has the edge of addressing all the threats to Peace in Africa and our key concerns, and proposing actions which together we must take as part of the much desired international partnership. Thus, the idea of an International Forum on Peace, Security and Development in Africa is of interest to us and has our full backing.
Of great concern to us is the situation in the Central African Republic, a neighbouring country to Cameroon. I wish to commend the International Community’s mobilization and determination to work with us.
I am thinking of the United Nations Organization whose Security Council has just adopted Resolution S/2013/717 under Chapter 7 of its Charter.
I am also thinking of the commitment of France, its prompt response to appeals from the authorities of the Central African Republic. We appreciate its decision to send troops to back the ECCAS forces already on the ground. By so doing, we will, together, ensure the protection of civilians and restore security and State authority throughout this brotherly country.
Such contribution by the International Community to Peace Keeping in Africa is, of course, not a waiver of the key responsibility of Africans in the search for peace.
Mister President,
Africa is referred to as the continent of the future. We readily add that Africa is a land of growth for France, the European Union and the World.
I would like to conclude my address where I started by thanking the President of the French Republic, Mr François Hollande. Mr President, you had the brilliant idea of inviting us to this beautiful city of Paris to jointly seek ways of furthering Africa-France partnership. Such partnership presupposes the establishment of peace without which no development action is possible.
Thank you for the commitment from France, the European Union and the United Nations Organization alongside Africa in its quest for peace, security and development.

On behalf of the delegation accompanying me and on my personal behalf, I would like to hail the positive initiative taken by France to organize a special meeting on endangered species, particularly elephants, on the sidelines of the Summit. The threat posed to elephants by heavily armed and well-trained poachers also jeopardizes peace and security in the regions where they operate. To effectively combat them, it is necessary to adopt concerted action. Such are the expectations of this meeting.
Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,
As you are aware, my country suffered repeated assaults by poachers recently. We have not forgotten the sad display of elephants slaughtered at Bouba Ndjidda by these heavily armed and well trained lawless men, as I have said, attracted by ivory.
To address this situation which reached its climax in early 2012, I took a number of measures at national level, and others in consultation with neighbouring countries which also suffer from this scourge.
At national level, we have taken vigorous actions in favour of national parks and protected areas in general. Accordingly, we have decided to:     
-deploy specialized defence forces in the Bouba Ndjidda area;
-increase the number of eco-guards;
-purchase ultra-light aircraft for aerial surveillance of protected areas;
These measures have helped to curb the phenomenon, sending poachers far away from our borders.
I have also prescribed the implementation of stringent measures, including a five-year contingency plan to secure protected areas, with special emphasis on the protection of elephants, on the one hand, and to equip and manage conservation areas, on the other. 
To combat cross-border poaching, we signed the following agreements with neighbouring countries:
-The Sangha Tri-National Cooperation Agreement, for  protected areas between Cameroon, CAR and Congo;
-The so-called Tridom Cooperation Agreement, for protected areas between Cameroon, Congo and Gabon, and;
-The Tri-National Anti-Poaching Agreement between Cameroon, CAR and Chad.
Recently, Yaounde hosted a meeting of the Ministers in charge of Wildlife of the Central African Economic and Monetary Community. It should be noted that this meeting was convened to adopt an Extreme Emergency Anti-poaching Plan (PEXULAB) in the sub-region.
Besides this meeting, we embarked on other cross-border biodiversity conservation activities with Nigeria and Equatorial Guinea.
Given the seriousness and importance of this issue, we deem it urgent to include a specific anti-poaching item on the agenda of the next ECCAS meeting.
Excellences Heads of State, Government and Delegation, 
To be effective and sustainable, these actions must be backed by the international community. Such support may take several forms, three of which are a priority:
-Building the capacities of anti-poaching frontline States (training, equipment and development of protected areas). The cost of such a programme, for Cameroon, is estimated at EUR 7 000 000;
-Financing Cameroon’s National Protected Areas Emergency Securement Plan, estimated at EUR 192 000 000 for the period 2012-2017;
-Closing markets where ivory and its by-products are sold.
We hope that today’s meeting marks the dawn of collective awareness in Europe and Africa. To this end, it must put forward proposals for concerted action to mobilize international public opinion to support this crusade in the interest of mankind.

•Ladies and Gentlemen, 
 
Let me begin by thanking the Bassa chiefs, the traditional rulers, for the wonderful gifts they have offered me and my wife. These gifts certainly symbolize their attachment to us and to the Republic.
Here we are in Douala, more precisely in Ndogpassi, to inaugurate the natural gas processing unit constructed by RODEO Development Limited.
 
Permit me first, to thank the Government Delegate to the Douala City Council for his words of welcome and his kind words addressed to me and my wife yesterday and today. 
 
I would also like to reiterate my appreciation to the people of Douala, our economic capital, for their warm welcome, very warm welcome. 
 
Lastly, I want the General Manager of RODEO Development Limited and his entire team to know that Cameroon fully appreciates the huge investments that have been made under the NDOGPASSI gas field concession, in Douala III Subdivision, which investments I am pleased to salute and discover today. 
 
What our partners have accomplished is designed to maximize the value of the NDOGPASSI natural gas field particularly for the State of Cameroon, represented here by the National Hydrocarbons Corporation (SNH). The putting into production by RODEO of proven natural gas reserves confirmed by drilling additional wells in the NDOGPASSI gas field and the drilling of development wells to boost proven, probable and possible natural gas reserves is fully in line with our policy of exploring and exploiting  hydrocarbon deposits.
 
Valued at more than 100 million US dollars, that is, about 50 billion CFA francs, there is no gainsaying that these investments will produce many positive economic, technological and social effects, to mention just these few, for the benefit of the population and enterprises in the city of Douala. 
 
•Ladies and Gentlemen, 
•Distinguished Guests, 
 
As I have often said, energy is at the core of any development process. Without it, there can neither be industry nor processing of raw materials, and hence,   there can be no modern economy.
That is why I have put the issue of energy at the centre of our ""Major Accomplishments"" policy. In this light, the Government has adopted an energy sector development plan, which seeks to significantly boost our energy production, expand the distribution networks and develop renewable energies. The construction of the Lom Pangar, Memve'ele and Mekin dams is proof that this programme is in progress. The development of a hydro-electricity project on the Sanaga River will complement this system. Concerning the development of our gas potential, this is still under way in the Kribi area. The activity of RODEO Development Ltd NDOGPASSI is part and parcel of this process.
At this juncture, I would like to hail the participation of our British partner, Victoria Oil and Gas PLC, which, through its Cameroon subsidiary Rodeo Development Limited, has partnered with us to develop our energy sector. I count on the latter to ensure, in conjunction with the authorities and local residents, an appropriate socio-environmental impact and a reasonable number of job opportunities.
•Ladies and Gentlemen,
As you can see, we are forging ahead. Cautiously but resolutely, in the field of energy, as in other areas, roads, the mining sector but also education and health.
 
At one time, the infantry was hailed as    the queen of battle. Today, the same saying could be paraphrased that energy is the queen of the battle for development and progress. Together, we will win this battle.
 
I now solemnly declare open the NDOGPASSI gas processing unit, in Douala III Subdivision, Wouri Division, Littoral Region.
 
Thank you for your attention.-

We are here today in Douala to lay the foundation stone of the second bridge over the Wouri River.
First, let me say that I am very pleased to meet you once more in your city, so industrious, the heartbeat of our country’s economy, the meeting place and melting pot of our populations.
Permit me to thank the Government Delegate to the Douala City Council for his words of welcome and the kind words he has spoken to me and my wife. I cannot forget to thank the Minister of State, Esso, who found the right words to describe the moments I shared a few decades ago with the notables of this region. I thank him sincerely as well as the traditional leaders of Littoral for the ritual which may appear insignificant, but which is initiatory, and for their gifts.
Naturally, I also thank the dynamic people of the Littoral Region, particularly those of Douala and its environs, for their exceptional warm welcome, for their commitment and loyalty. I would like to seize this opportunity to congratulate the people of Douala and, through them, all the people of Cameroon for maintaining calm, serenity and maturity during the recent elections.
 I cannot forget to thank the personalities that have honoured us with their presence at this ceremony.
• Ladies and Gentlemen,
The construction of a bridge is always an important task. Indeed, a bridge is a symbol. It helps to link two banks of a river or an arm of the sea, to span a valley or a cliff. In short, it helps to surmount an obstacle to the movement of people and goods. It is a means devised by man to control nature.
But a bridge is also a landmark on a map that identifies with a particular city, like the Tower Bridge in London or the Pont Neuf in Paris. Nowadays, bridges are engineering structures that reflect technological progress like the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco or the Tancarville Bridge over the Seine.
The case in point involves all these aspects, although the immediate objective is to facilitate road and rail traffic between the two banks of the Wouri River. Since the existing bridge can no longer bear the ever-increasing volume of traffic, under the best conditions, it became necessary to build a second bridge. It will help to ease trade between the economic capital and the regions situated in the west of the Wouri River. Given that 80% of food products intended for Douala cross the Wouri River from West to East, as well as trade in other goods in both directions, of course, it is necessary to develop this passage.
The utilitarian aspect of the construction of this second bridge does not stop us from hoping that it will, like the famous structures I have just mentioned, be an engineering structure whose attractiveness will win it global fame. In this regard, let us put our trust in the architects and the builder, and in the Minister of Public Works.
The construction of the second bridge over the Wouri River is part of major infrastructure to facilitate transportation across our country. When supplemented by the upgrading of the east and west entry roads to Douala, crossing our economic metropolis will be easier and faster, thus saving time and enhancing the competitiveness of our companies. In more general terms, this bridge will strengthen Douala’s position as the main economic platform of our country and sub-region.
Permit me to outline the main, albeit not too technical features as those presented by the Minister of Public Works, of the structure whose foundation stone will be laid today, to give you an idea of its magnitude. The bridge will be more than 800 metres long, with five traffic lanes and two railway lines, representing a right-of-way of about 25 metres. Two kilometres of access roads will link it to the Douala arterial system. The existing bridge, which is at the end of its life-span will, it must be pointed out, be reserved for pedestrians and two-wheeled vehicles, thereby facilitating their movement. It will therefore be renovated to guarantee the safety of users.
For a long time, the state of our road network has been an impediment to our economy. In recent years, it has been significantly improved. I would like to take this opportunity to confirm that other major road works will soon be launched. These include the first phase of the new Yaounde – Douala highway, the Kumba–Mamfe road, the continuation of work on the Ring Road, the rehabilitation of two sections of the Garoua–Kousseri road and the second section of the Foumban–Manki road as well as the completion of the Meïganga–Ngaoundere road section.
Thus, our cities and main production zones will, in the short and medium term, be linked to the Douala, Limbe and Kribi ports by a modern road network. It is easy to imagine the resultant benefits this will have for our agriculture and industry and, of course, our economy in general. 
This is only a part of our infrastructure development programme which is vital to our country’s modernization. Without going into detail, I will recall the facilities whose construction is in progress or planned in the area of energy, the development of our coastline in Kribi or Limbe, the construction of school and university, health and social housing facilities.
Yes, with every passing day, Cameroon is becoming the “vast construction site” I told you about some time ago.
Before I conclude, I want to express my gratitude to France, one of our traditional partners whose assistance over the past decades has remained constant and significant. I would also like to extend my sincere appreciation to the French Development Agency which has supported our efforts to build a second bridge over the Wouri River and continues to assist us in various domains within the framework of the Debt Reduction and Development Contract (C2D).
• Ladies and Gentlemen,
Each bridge, each road, each hospital, each school, each low-cost house is a further step towards modernity and, ultimately, towards an emerging nation. This goal that we have set ourselves does not concern the Government alone. It is everybody’s business. Everybody, in his/her position in our society, can and should contribute to achieving this goal. Together, let us build a bridge towards a better future for our country, no matter the odds.
Thank you for your kind attention.",https://prc.cm
